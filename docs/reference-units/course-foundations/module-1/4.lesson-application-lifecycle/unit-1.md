title: Application.cfc & Request Lifecycle

name: application-cfc-lifecycle-unit-1

## What is Application.cfc?

`Application.cfc` is the framework entry point for every ColdFusion web application. Drop it in the web root and ColdFusion automatically invokes its lifecycle methods at the right moment — no configuration file, no XML, no registration step.

It replaces the older `Application.cfm` approach and gives you a clean OO structure: one component, one place to configure your entire application.

## Lifecycle order

Each request triggers a predictable sequence of method calls:

| Step | Method | Fires |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | `onApplicationStart` | Once per application start/restart |
| 2 | `onSessionStart` | Once per new user session |
| 3 | `onRequestStart` | Before every page request |
| 4 | `onRequest` | The actual page (if defined; otherwise CF runs the `.cfm` directly) |
| 5 | `onRequestEnd` | After every page request |
| 6 | `onSessionEnd` | When a session times out |
| 7 | `onApplicationEnd` | When the application shuts down |

## Activity 1 — Create Application.cfc

**Activity:** Click the **Terminal** tab in your lab. Copy and paste the script below to create a minimal `Application.cfc` in the web root:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc << 'EOF'
component {

  this.name              = "CFTraining";
  this.sessionManagement = true;
  this.sessionTimeout    = createTimeSpan(0, 0, 30, 0);  // 30 minutes

  public boolean function onApplicationStart() {
    application.startTime = now();
    writeLog(text="Application started at #now()#", file="application");
    return true;
  }

  public boolean function onSessionStart() {
    session.userId = 0;
    return true;
  }

  public boolean function onRequestStart(string targetPage) {
    return true;
  }

  public void function onError(any exception, string eventName) {
    writeOutput("An error occurred: #exception.message#");
  }

}
EOF
```

Verify it was created:

```bash
ls -lh /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc
```

---
#active
Click the **Terminal** tab and run the `sudo tee` command above to create `Application.cfc` in the web root.

#completed
`Application.cfc` exists in the web root. ✓
::

---

## Activity 2 — Verify onApplicationStart fires

The `onApplicationStart` method you just added writes to the application scope and logs to the CF log file. Trigger it by making any request to the engine:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8500/index.cfm
# Expected: 200
```

Now confirm `onApplicationStart` is defined in the file:

```bash
grep "onApplicationStart" /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc
```

::image-box
---
:src: __static__/terminal-onapplicationstart-grep-v1.png
:alt: Terminal window showing the grep command output — one matching line from Application.cfc with the onApplicationStart function signature highlighted, confirming the method is present in the file

:name: verify_onapplicationstart
---
#active
Confirm `onApplicationStart()` is defined in `Application.cfc` — the file must contain the string `onApplicationStart`.

#completed
`onApplicationStart` is defined. ✓
::

---

## Key `this.*` settings

The `this.*` block at the top of `Application.cfc` configures the entire application before any request is processed:

```cfml
component {
  this.name              = "HelpDesk";             // required — unique app identifier
  this.sessionManagement = true;                   // enable session scope
  this.sessionTimeout    = createTimeSpan(0,1,0,0);  // 1 hour
  this.clientManagement  = false;
  this.datasource        = "training_db";          // default datasource for cfquery

  // ORM settings (covered in the ORM lesson)
  this.ormenabled        = false;
}
```

| Setting | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `this.name` | Unique app identifier — required, determines application scope boundary |
| `this.sessionManagement` | Enables `session.*` scope |
| `this.sessionTimeout` | How long before an idle session expires |
| `this.datasource` | Default datasource — pages can omit `datasource` in `<cfquery>` |
| `this.ormenabled` | Enables Hibernate ORM (covered later) |

## Activity 3 — Verify this.name is set

Your `Application.cfc` already has `this.name = "CFTraining"`. Confirm it:

```bash
grep "this.name" /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc
# Expected: this.name = "CFTraining";
```

Then make a request and confirm the app responds without errors:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8500/index.cfm
# Expected: 200
```

::image-box

::

Open the **ColdFusion 2025** tab (right-click → Open in New Tab) and browse to your lab root — CF Admin login page appearing means the engine is running with your `Application.cfc` active.

::image-box
---
:src: __static__/browser-cf-admin-app-running-v1.png

:max-width: 860px
---
_CF Admin login page — log in with password `admin`._
::

Log in with password `admin`. Now verify your `Application.cfc` is active in two ways:

**1 — /status.cfm (fastest)**

`status.cfm` is a diagnostic page pre-installed in the web root — you don't need to create it. In the **ColdFusion 2025** browser tab, right-click → **Open Link in New Tab**, then change the path to `/status.cfm`. The page reads directly from the running CF engine and shows:

- **this.name** — confirms `Application.cfc` is loaded and `CFTraining` is the app name
- **onApplicationStart** — shows `fired — <timestamp>` if `onApplicationStart()` ran and set `application.startTime`
- **JVM memory** — live heap usage
- **Session management** — confirms sessions are enabled

::

**2 — CF Admin → Debugging & Logging → Log Files**

In CF Admin, go to **Debugging & Logging → Log Files** in the left navigation. Open `application.log` — you should see the line written by `writeLog()` in `onApplicationStart()`, timestamped to when the application first started.

::image-box
---

> **Note on Performance Monitoring Toolset:** The PMT button in CF Admin requires a separate PMT Server + Elastic Stack (Elasticsearch + Kibana) that is not running in this lab. See the hint box below for the full explanation. Full PMT setup is covered in a **separate ColdFusion Monitoring & Observability course**.

## onRequestStart as a gatekeeper

A common pattern is to enforce authentication in `onRequestStart`. It runs before every page — making it the ideal place to check whether the user is logged in:

```cfml
public boolean function onRequestStart(string targetPage) {
  var publicPages = ["/login.cfm", "/register.cfm"];
  if (!session.userId && !arrayFind(publicPages, arguments.targetPage)) {
    location(url="/login.cfm", addtoken=false);
    return false;  // abort the request — page will not execute
  }
  return true;
}
```

Returning `false` from `onRequestStart` stops the request entirely — the target page never runs. This is how CF apps enforce login gates without touching every individual page.

::hint-box
---
:summary: How do I restart the application to re-trigger onApplicationStart?
---

`onApplicationStart` only fires once — on the very first request after the engine starts or after the application is explicitly restarted. To force it to re-run during development:

**Option 1 — From CF Admin:**
1. Open CF Admin (right-click the ColdFusion 2025 tab → Open in New Tab)
2. Log in with password `admin`
3. Go to **Server Settings → Memory Variables**
4. Click **Clear Application Scope** next to your app name

**Option 2 — From the Terminal:**
```bash
sudo systemctl restart coldfusion
# Wait ~15 seconds, then:
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8500/index.cfm
```

::

::hint-box
---
:summary: What is the Performance Monitoring Toolset really, and why can't I use it fully here?
---

The CF Admin button labelled **Performance Monitoring Toolset** is more complex than it looks. It is not a simple built-in dashboard — it is a connection point to a **separate, external infrastructure stack**.

**The full PMT architecture:**

```
ColdFusion 2025
   │  pmtagent (CF package) — ships metrics out via REST
   ▼
PMT Server  ← separate Adobe download, runs as its own Java process
   │  stores and indexes data in ▼
   ▼
Elastic Stack
   ├── Elasticsearch  ← stores all metrics and log data
   ├── Logstash       ← ingests and transforms the data stream
   └── Kibana         ← the actual dashboards you interact with
```

**What `cfpm.sh install pmtagent` does:** it installs only the **CF-side agent** — the part that collects metrics and sends them out. Without a running PMT Server + Elasticsearch + Kibana on the receiving end, clicking the button in CF Admin will either show a connection error or an empty screen.

**Why this lab cannot run full PMT:** Elasticsearch alone requires 4–8 GB of heap. This lab VM has 2 GB total RAM — running Elasticsearch here would leave no memory for ColdFusion itself.

**What you can explore in this lab:** navigate to `/status.cfm` to see live engine and application scope data, or use CF Admin → **Debugging & Logging → Log Files** to read what `onApplicationStart` logged. These give you a real window into lifecycle behaviour without the Elastic Stack.

> **Full PMT setup — PMT Server installation, Elasticsearch + Logstash + Kibana configuration, CF Admin connection (hostname, port, shared secret), and Kibana dashboard import — is a dedicated operations topic covered in a **separate ColdFusion Monitoring & Observability course**, not this Foundations course or the Advanced Course.**

:summary: Going further — ColdFusion as a backend for React, Vue, or Angular
---

Once you are comfortable with `Application.cfc` you may wonder how it fits into a modern frontend stack. The short answer: **React owns the UI, ColdFusion owns the data and business logic, and they meet at a JSON API boundary.**

```
Browser (React)                    Server (ColdFusion)
───────────────────                ──────────────────────────────
Components / State                 Application.cfc (session, auth, CORS)
     │                                      │
     │  fetch("/api/tickets")  ────────────►│  TicketService.cfc → cfquery → DB
     │◄────────────────────────  JSON       │  serializeJSON(result)
     │
  renders UI
```

`Application.cfc` becomes your API gateway — handling CORS headers, JWT token validation, and authentication before any endpoint runs. React never touches the database; ColdFusion never touches the DOM.

| Concern | Owner |
|---|---|
| Routes / UI components | React |
| Business rules & validation | ColdFusion CFC |
| Database access | ColdFusion (`cfquery` / ORM) |
| Auth / sessions / CORS | ColdFusion `Application.cfc` |

> **This topic is outside the scope of this Foundations course.** It is covered in depth — including JWT auth, CORS configuration, REST endpoint design, and ColdBox MVC — in the **ColdFusion Advanced Course**.

::hint-box

:summary: Does ColdFusion have a dedicated API gateway or load balancer?
---

**No — Adobe does not sell a dedicated API gateway or load balancer.** ColdFusion is a CFML application server, not an infrastructure product. Here is how the pieces fit together and who provides what:

| Layer | What it does | Who provides it |
|---|---|---|
| **Load balancer** | Distributes traffic across multiple CF instances | Nginx, HAProxy, AWS ALB, Cloudflare — not Adobe |
| **API Gateway** | Rate limiting, routing rules, analytics, API keys | Kong, AWS API Gateway, Azure APIM — not Adobe |
| **SSL termination** | HTTPS → HTTP handoff before CF sees the request | Nginx, Cloudflare, load balancer — not Adobe |
| **Application.cfc** | Auth, CORS, session setup, error handling | ColdFusion — this is the CF-native layer |
| **CF API Manager** | Lightweight API publish/throttle layer | Adobe — bundled with CF Enterprise edition only |

**What is CF API Manager?**
Adobe ColdFusion Enterprise ships with a built-in **API Manager** — a basic gateway that lets you publish, version, throttle, and secure CF REST endpoints from a UI. It is not a full Kong or AWS API Gateway replacement, but it covers the most common needs for teams that want governance over their CF APIs without adding external infrastructure.

- Available only in **ColdFusion Enterprise** (not Standard or Developer Edition)
- Provides: endpoint registration, API keys, throttling, subscriber management, analytics
- Does **not** provide: load balancing, SSL termination, or cross-service routing

**What about load balancing?**
ColdFusion itself has no load balancer. If you run multiple CF instances you put Nginx or a cloud load balancer in front. A load balancer and an API gateway are two different tools — you can have one without the other:

- **Load balancer only** — splits traffic across CF nodes, no API key or rate-limit awareness
- **API gateway only** — manages API contracts and throttling, forwards to a single CF instance
- **Both** — typical for high-traffic production: load balancer handles scale, API gateway handles governance

**The typical production stack:**

```
Internet
   │
   ▼
Nginx  ←── SSL termination + static files + load balance across CF nodes
   │
   ▼
ColdFusion cluster (2–N nodes)
   │  Application.cfc handles auth, CORS, session
   │
   ▼
Database (MySQL / PostgreSQL / MSSQL)
```

For larger teams, Kong or AWS API Gateway sits between Nginx and CF to add rate limiting and API key management. **For most ColdFusion applications, Nginx + Application.cfc is all you need.**

> **This topic is outside the scope of this Foundations course.** Infrastructure architecture, CF clustering, and API Manager configuration are covered in the **ColdFusion Advanced Course**.
