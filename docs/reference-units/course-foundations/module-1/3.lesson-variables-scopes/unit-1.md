## Data types

ColdFusion is dynamically typed. Variables are created on assignment and their type is inferred at runtime — no `int`, `String`, or `var` declarations required.

| Type | Example | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| String | `"Hello"` | Immutable; `&` concatenates |
| Numeric | `42`, `3.14` | Integer and float unified |
| Boolean | `true`, `false`, `yes`, `no` | `yes`/`no` are aliases |
| Date | `now()`, `"2026-09-03"` | Rich date/time functions built in |
| Array | `[1, 2, 3]` | 1-based index |
| Struct | `{name: "Alex", age: 30}` | Key-value map; keys case-insensitive |
| Query | result of `cfquery` / `queryExecute()` | Tabular result set |

_CFML's six core data types — dynamically inferred at runtime, no explicit type declarations needed._
::

**Activity:** Click the **Terminal** tab in your lab. Once the terminal is open, copy and paste the script below to create `data_types.cfm` and explore all six data types:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/data_types.cfm << 'EOF'
<cfscript>
  // String
  myString = "Hello ColdFusion";
  writeOutput("<strong>String:</strong> " & myString & "<br>");

  // Numeric
  myInt  = 42;
  myFloat = 3.14;
  writeOutput("<strong>Numeric:</strong> " & myInt & " / " & myFloat & "<br>");

  // Boolean
  isActive = true;
  writeOutput("<strong>Boolean:</strong> " & isActive & "<br>");

  // Date
  today = now();
  writeOutput("<strong>Date:</strong> " & dateFormat(today, "yyyy-mm-dd") & "<br>");

  // Array
  fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
  writeOutput("<strong>Array[1]:</strong> " & fruits[1] & "<br>");

  // Struct
  person = {name: "Alex", age: 30};
  writeOutput("<strong>Struct:</strong> " & person.name & " is " & person.age & "<br>");
</cfscript>
EOF
```

Open `/data_types.cfm` in the **ColdFusion 2025** browser tab (right-click → Open Link in New Tab, then change the path). Or from the Terminal:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/data_types.cfm
```

## Variable scopes

ColdFusion organises variables into named scopes. Every scope has a different lifetime and visibility.

| Scope | Prefix | Lifetime | Typical use |
|---|---|---|---|
| `variables` | `variables.` | Single request | Default local scope for a page/CFC |
| `url` | `url.` | Single request | Query-string parameters |
| `form` | `form.` | Single request | POST form fields |
| `request` | `request.` | Single request | Pass data between included files |
| `session` | `session.` | User session | Per-user state (cart, login) |
| `application` | `application.` | App lifetime | Shared config, counters |
| `server` | `server.` | Server lifetime | Rarely written; read CF/Lucee version |

The `variables` scope is the default when you omit a prefix. Always prefix `session.*` and `application.*` explicitly.

:alt: Horizontal bar chart showing CFML scope lifetimes from shortest to longest — from top: url/form/request (single request, narrow bar), variables (single request, same width), local/arguments (function call duration, shortest), session (user session lifetime, medium bar), application (application lifetime, long bar), server (server process lifetime, longest bar) — bars are colour-coded from short (red) to long (green)
:max-width: 860px
---
_Scope lifetimes compared — request-scoped variables are cheapest; application-scoped variables persist for the life of the process._
::

**Activity:** Still in the **Terminal** tab, copy and paste the script below to create `scopes.cfm` and demonstrate the `variables` scope explicitly:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/scopes.cfm << 'EOF'
<cfscript>
  // variables scope — explicit prefix
  variables.name    = "Alex";
  variables.course  = "ColdFusion 2025";

  writeOutput("<strong>variables.name:</strong> "   & variables.name   & "<br>");
  writeOutput("<strong>variables.course:</strong> " & variables.course & "<br>");

  // url scope — reads ?name= from the query string
  urlName = url.name ?: "no name passed";
  writeOutput("<strong>url.name:</strong> " & urlName & "<br>");
</cfscript>
EOF
```

Open `/scopes.cfm` in the browser to confirm the `variables` scope output:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/scopes.cfm
```

::image-box
---
:src: __static__/browser-output-scopes-v1.png
:alt: Browser window showing the rendered output of scopes.cfm — three lines: variables.name showing Alex, variables.course showing ColdFusion 2025, url.name showing no name passed (because no query string was provided)
:max-width: 860px
---
_`scopes.cfm` with no query string — `variables.*` values are set, `url.name` falls back to the default._
::

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_scopes_page
---
#active
Create `scopes.cfm` — the response must contain the word **variables**.

#completed
`scopes.cfm` demonstrates variable scopes. ✓
::

---

Now verify that the `variables.` prefix is used explicitly in the file:

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_variables_scope
---
#active
Confirm `scopes.cfm` uses the `variables.` prefix explicitly — the file must contain `variables.`.

#completed
The `variables` scope is explicitly prefixed. ✓
::

---

## URL scope

Pass a query-string parameter and read it back with `url.name`:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8500/scopes.cfm?name=TestUser"
# Expected: url.name: TestUser
```

Or in the browser, append `?name=TestUser` to the URL:

```
https://<your-session-id>.iximiuz.com/scopes.cfm?name=TestUser
```

::image-box
---
:src: __static__/browser-output-scopes-url-v1.png
:alt: Browser window showing the rendered output of scopes.cfm?name=TestUser — three lines: variables.name showing Alex, variables.course showing ColdFusion 2025, url.name showing TestUser (the value passed in the query string)
:max-width: 860px
---
_With `?name=TestUser` appended, `url.name` resolves to **TestUser** instead of the default._
::

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_url_scope
---
#active
Visit `scopes.cfm?name=TestUser` — the response must echo back **TestUser** from the URL scope.

#completed
URL scope is working — `?name=TestUser` is reflected in the output. ✓

## Scope resolution order

::image-box
---
:src: __static__/cfml-scope-resolution-order-v1.png
:alt: Numbered vertical flowchart showing ColdFusion's unqualified variable lookup order — step 1: local (inside CFC function), step 2: arguments, step 3: thread, step 4: query (inside cfloop query), step 5: variables, step 6: cgi/file/url/form/cookie/client — each step is a rounded rectangle, connected by downward arrows, with a "found → stop" branch on the right side of each box
:max-width: 640px
---
_When you omit a scope prefix, CF walks this resolution chain top-to-bottom — always prefix to be explicit._
::

When you write just `name` without a prefix, ColdFusion checks scopes in this order:

1. `local` (inside a CFC function)
2. `arguments`
3. `thread`
4. `query` (inside a `<cfloop query="...">`)
5. `variables`
6. `cgi`, `file`, `url`, `form`, `cookie`, `client`

**Always prefix to be explicit and avoid scope-bleed bugs.** In a large application, an unqualified variable that accidentally resolves from `url` instead of `variables` can cause hard-to-trace security issues.

ColdFusion has a built-in debugging tool — `cfdump`. It renders any variable, struct, array, or scope as a formatted HTML table, perfect for exploring what's actually in scope at runtime.

```cfml
<cfdump var="#variables#" label="variables scope">
<cfdump var="#url#"       label="url scope">
<cfdump var="#session#"   label="session scope">
```

Add those lines temporarily to any `.cfm` file, reload in the browser, and you get a complete view of every variable in each scope. Remove them before going to production.

If you need to tweak `scopes.cfm` without rewriting it from scratch:

```bash
vi /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/scopes.cfm
```

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `i` | Enter insert mode |
| `Esc` | Back to normal mode |
| `:wq` + Enter | Save and quit |
| `:q!` + Enter | Quit without saving |
