## What is ColdFusion?

ColdFusion is a **rapid web-application development platform** built around CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language). It lets you query databases, send email, consume web services, and render HTML responses with far less ceremony than most general-purpose languages. A single CFML tag can replace dozens of lines of boilerplate in other languages.

The platform has two layers:

- **CFML** — the language itself: a hybrid of HTML-like tags (`<cfquery>`, `<cfloop>`) and a modern ECMAScript-style scripting block (`<cfscript>`).
- **The CFML engine** — the Java-based runtime that compiles `.cfm`/`.cfc` files to bytecode and executes them inside a servlet container (historically JRun, today Apache Tomcat).

## A brief history of CFML

The story of ColdFusion starts in 1995, long before Ruby on Rails or Node.js, with a small startup called **Allaire Corporation**.

::

CFML was one of the web's original "batteries included" platforms. While other stacks require composing separate libraries for database access, file I/O, and HTTP clients, ColdFusion ships all of that in the core runtime. This philosophy still defines it today.

---

## Problems ColdFusion solves

### 1. Database access without boilerplate

In most languages you open a connection, prepare a statement, bind parameters, iterate a result set, and close the connection. In CFML:

```cfml
<cfquery name="users" datasource="myDB">
  SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE active = 1
</cfquery>

<cfoutput query="users">
  #users.name# — #users.email#<br>
</cfoutput>
```

The engine manages the connection pool, parameterises the query, and returns a strongly-typed `query` object you can iterate with a single tag.

### 2. File and email operations in one line

```cfml
<!--- Send email --->
<cfmail to="user@example.com" from="app@example.com" subject="Welcome" type="html">
  <p>Your account is ready.</p>
</cfmail>

<!--- Upload a file --->
<cffile action="upload" fileField="myFile" destination="/var/uploads" nameConflict="makeUnique">
```

### 3. HTTP and web-service consumption

```cfml
<cfhttp url="https://api.example.com/data.json" method="GET" result="resp">
  <cfhttpparam type="header" name="Authorization" value="Bearer #token#">
</cfhttp>

<cfset data = deserializeJSON(resp.fileContent)>
```

### 4. Rapid page rendering

ColdFusion pages are compiled to Java bytecode on first request and cached. Subsequent requests hit the bytecode cache directly, giving competitive throughput without a separate compile step during development.

## How ColdFusion's architecture works

::image-box
---
:src: __static__/coldfusion-request-architecture-v1.png
:alt: ColdFusion request architecture diagram — browser sends an HTTP request to an optional Nginx reverse proxy, which forwards via AJP or mod_cfml to Apache Tomcat, which hands off to the CFML engine; the engine parses and compiles the .cfm file to Java bytecode on first request (cached on subsequent requests), executes it, accesses the datasource connection pool via JDBC to reach the database, optionally checks the ehcache tier, writes to the response buffer, and returns HTML or JSON to the browser
:max-width: 900px
---
_The ColdFusion request pipeline: browser → (optional) reverse proxy → Tomcat → CFML engine → JDBC datasource pool → response._
::

Key architectural points:

- **Everything runs on the JVM.** You can call any Java class from CFML, use Java libraries on the classpath, and read JVM metrics with standard tools.
- **Datasources** are named connection pools configured in the CF Admin or via `Application.cfc`. Pages reference them by name, not by connection string.
- **Application scope** is shared across all requests within one application context, making in-memory caching trivial.
- **The web root** is a folder watched by the engine; dropping a `.cfm` file there makes it immediately accessible with no restart or deploy step.

---

## ColdFusion and the JEE platform

ColdFusion is built on top of the **Java Enterprise Edition (JEE)** platform and uses a JEE application server for its core services — database connectivity, naming and directory services, and other runtime infrastructure. This is not just an implementation detail: it directly shapes what you can do with ColdFusion applications.

ColdFusion can be deployed in two ways:

- **Server configuration** — ColdFusion ships with a bundled JEE server (Apache Tomcat). This is the standard setup and what you are using in this lab.
- **JEE configuration (Enterprise only)** — ColdFusion can be deployed as a WAR/EAR on an independent JEE application server such as IBM WebSphere, Oracle WebLogic, or JBoss.

By running on top of the JEE platform, ColdFusion inherits its power while hiding its complexity behind CFML tags and functions. This also means ColdFusion pages can integrate directly with the Java ecosystem:

| Capability | What it means in practice |
|---|---|
| **Share session data with JSPs and Java servlets** | CFML and Java code running in the same container can read and write the same `session` scope |
| **Import JSP tag libraries** | Custom JSP tags can be imported and used like ColdFusion custom tags |
| **Integrate with Java objects** | You can call any Java class, JavaBean, or Enterprise JavaBean directly from CFML using `createObject("java", ...)` |
| **Access the full JEE Java API** | JDBC drivers, JMS, JNDI, and other JEE APIs are available to CFML code |

::hint-box
---
:summary: 💡 Why does this matter for CFML developers?
---
Understanding that ColdFusion runs inside a JVM servlet container explains several behaviours you will encounter throughout this course:

- Why CF configuration lives in `WEB-INF/` and `cfclasses/` directories
- Why restarting CF is sometimes needed to pick up code changes (the JVM class cache)
- Why you can drop `.jar` files into the classpath and call Java libraries from CFML
- Why performance tuning involves JVM flags (`-Xmx`, `-Xms`, GC settings) as much as CFML-level changes

## Adobe ColdFusion vs. Lucee

Both engines execute the same CFML language core, but they differ in licensing, extension model, and some built-in capabilities.

:max-width: 560px
---
_Adobe ColdFusion 2025 (port 8500) and Lucee 7 (port 8888) — both run in your lab environment._
::

| Feature | Adobe ColdFusion 2025 | Lucee 7 |
|---|---|---|
| **License** | Commercial (Developer Edition free, production licensed) | Open source (LGPL) |
| **Servlet container** | Bundled Tomcat | Any container; CommandBox bundles its own |
| **Admin console** | `/CFIDE/administrator` | `/lucee/admin/` |
| **PDF generation** | Native (`<cfdocument>`) | Via extension (PDF extension required) |
| **ORM** | Hibernate (built-in) | Hibernate (built-in) |
| **Language extensions** | Adobe-only tags (e.g., `<cfpresentation>`) | Lucee-only features (e.g., `systemOutput()`) |
| **Script-first style** | Both tag and script equally supported | Script-first recommended |
| **Cold start speed** | Moderate (~30 s typical) | Fast (~5–10 s with CommandBox) |
| **Community** | Adobe forums, Adobe docs | Lucee community, CommandBox ecosystem |

- **Greenfield projects** can use either. Lucee + CommandBox is popular for local development because of fast cold starts and zero licensing cost.
- **Enterprise Adobe shops** use CF for support contracts, CF Admin policies, and built-in PDF/Office features.
- **This course** uses both: Adobe ColdFusion 2025 on port **8500** is the primary engine; Lucee 7 on port **8888** lets you verify cross-engine compatibility.

::hint-box
---
:summary: Why are two servers running in this lab?
---

Running both engines side by side reflects the real-world CFML ecosystem — Adobe CF and Lucee coexist in many organisations, and knowing both makes you a stronger developer.

For this course you don't need to master the differences right now. **The one thing to remember: all exercises run on Adobe ColdFusion 2025 at port `8500`.** Lucee is there on port `8888` if you want to explore it on your own, but it won't affect your task completions.

| Service | Port | Web root |
|---|---|---|
| Adobe ColdFusion 2025 | `8500` | `/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/` |
| CommandBox + Lucee 7.0 | `8888` | `/home/laborant/app/` |
| VS Code (code-server) | IDE tab | Opens the webroot of ColdFusion 2025 |

> **Tip:** Files you create in VS Code land directly in the CF 2025 webroot. Open a Terminal inside VS Code to also write to the Lucee webroot.

## Verify services

Open the **Terminal** tab in your lab and run each command. A `200` status code confirms the service is ready.

```bash
# Verify Adobe ColdFusion 2025 (should return HTTP 200)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8500/index.cfm
```

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_cf_running
---
#active
Run the curl command above — confirm ColdFusion 2025 returns HTTP 200 on port 8500.

#completed
ColdFusion 2025 is running on port 8500. ✓
::

```bash
# Verify Lucee via CommandBox (should return HTTP 200)
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8888/index.cfm
```

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_lucee_running
---
#active
Run the curl command above — confirm Lucee returns HTTP 200 on port 8888.

#completed
Lucee is running on port 8888. ✓
::

### Create and test your first ColdFusion page

1. In VS Code, create a file called `hello.cfm` in the webroot.
2. Add this content:

```cfml
<cfset greeting = "Hello from ColdFusion 2025!">
<cfoutput>#greeting#</cfoutput>
```

3. Verify it through the engine:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/hello.cfm
# Expected output: Hello from ColdFusion 2025!
```

If you see the greeting text (not the raw CFML source), the engine compiled and executed your file correctly.

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_hello_cfm
---
#active
Create `/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/hello.cfm` that outputs a greeting containing the word **hello**.

#completed
`hello.cfm` exists and returns a greeting. ✓
