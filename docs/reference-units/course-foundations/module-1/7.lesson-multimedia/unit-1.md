## HTML5 media elements

HTML5 ships two native media elements — `<video>` and `<audio>` — that the browser renders with built-in playback controls. No plugins, no Flash, no third-party players required.

ColdFusion's role is server-side: it stores metadata, serves file paths, and handles uploads. The browser's `<video>` and `<audio>` elements do the actual playback.

```cfml
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>Media Demo</title>
</head>
<body>

  <h2>Video</h2>
  <video controls width="640" preload="metadata">
    <source src="/media/sample.mp4"  type="video/mp4">
    <source src="/media/sample.webm" type="video/webm">
    Your browser does not support HTML5 video.
  </video>

  <h2>Audio</h2>
  <audio controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/media/sample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="/media/sample.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    Your browser does not support HTML5 audio.
  </audio>

</body>
</html>
```

Multiple `<source>` tags let the browser pick the first format it supports — MP4/MP3 for broad compatibility, WebM/OGG as open-format fallbacks.

:summary: Video and audio format compatibility — which to use?
---

| Format | MIME type | Browser support | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| MP4 (H.264) | `video/mp4` | All modern browsers | Best compatibility — use as primary |
| WebM (VP9) | `video/webm` | Chrome, Firefox, Edge | Open format, smaller file size |
| OGG Theora | `video/ogg` | Firefox, Chrome | Older open format, less common today |
| MP3 | `audio/mpeg` | All modern browsers | Best audio compatibility |
| OGG Vorbis | `audio/ogg` | Firefox, Chrome | Open format audio fallback |

**The practical rule:** always provide MP4/MP3 first. Add WebM/OGG as a second `<source>` for open-format coverage. The browser picks the first it can play.

## Activity 1 — Create a media demo page

**Activity:** In the **Terminal** tab, create `media_demo.cfm` — an HTML5 page with both a `<video>` and an `<audio>` element. Because the lab does not have real media files, both elements use placeholder `src` paths but still demonstrate the correct markup and ColdFusion dynamic output:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/media_demo.cfm << 'EOF'
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
  <title>ColdFusion Media Demo</title>
  <style>
    body  { font-family: sans-serif; max-width: 700px; margin: 2rem auto; }
    video, audio { display: block; margin: 1rem 0; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>ColdFusion Media Demo</h1>

  <cfoutput>
    <p>Page generated at: <strong>#timeFormat(now(), "HH:mm:ss")#</strong></p>
  </cfoutput>

  <h2>Video</h2>
  <video controls width="640" preload="metadata">
    <source src="/media/sample.mp4"  type="video/mp4">
    <source src="/media/sample.webm" type="video/webm">
    <p>Your browser does not support HTML5 video.</p>
  </video>

  <h2>Audio</h2>
  <audio controls preload="metadata">
    <source src="/media/sample.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
    <source src="/media/sample.ogg" type="audio/ogg">
    <p>Your browser does not support HTML5 audio.</p>
  </audio>

</body>
</html>
EOF
```

Verify the page is served:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/media_demo.cfm | head -20
```

## HTML5 video and audio elements in depth

The `controls` attribute renders the browser's native playback UI. Additional attributes let you fine-tune behaviour:

| Attribute | Effect |
|---|---|
| `controls` | Show play/pause, volume, seek bar |
| `autoplay` | Start playing immediately (muted required in most browsers) |
| `muted` | Start muted — required for autoplay in Chrome/Safari |
| `loop` | Repeat indefinitely |
| `preload="none"` | Don't load any data until the user presses play |
| `preload="metadata"` | Load duration and dimensions only (default) |
| `preload="auto"` | Load the whole file on page load |
| `poster="/img/thumb.jpg"` | Image shown before playback starts (video only) |
| `width` / `height` | Video display dimensions in pixels |

#completed
HTML5 media element is present in `media_demo.cfm`. ✓

## File upload with cffile

`cffile action="upload"` handles multipart form submissions. ColdFusion validates the MIME type, resolves filename conflicts, and writes the file to disk:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  if (structKeyExists(form, "mediaFile")) {
    allowedTypes = "video/mp4,video/webm,audio/mpeg,audio/ogg";
    cffile(
      action       = "upload",
      filefield    = "mediaFile",
      destination  = expandPath("/uploads/media/"),
      accept       = allowedTypes,
      nameconflict = "makeunique"
    );
    writeOutput("Uploaded: " & cffile.serverFile);
  }
</cfscript>

<form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
  <input type="file" name="mediaFile" accept="video/*,audio/*">
  <button type="submit">Upload</button>
</form>
```

Key `cffile` properties after upload:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| `cffile.serverFile` | Filename on disk (after conflict resolution) |
| `cffile.serverDirectory` | Destination directory |
| `cffile.fileSize` | Size in bytes |
| `cffile.contentType` | MIME type reported by the browser |

::hint-box
---
:summary: Security rules for file uploads
---

Client-submitted data — including file names and MIME types — is untrusted. A malicious user can rename a `.php` file to `video.mp4` and submit it. Always apply all three defences:

1. **Validate the MIME type server-side** — the `accept` attribute on `cffile` checks the `Content-Type` header, but also inspect the actual file bytes with `imageIsValid()` for images or a magic-bytes check for video.
2. **Whitelist extensions explicitly:**

```cfml
allowedExts = ["mp4", "webm", "mp3", "ogg"];
ext = lCase(listLast(cffile.serverFile, "."));
if (!arrayFind(allowedExts, ext)) {
  fileDelete(cffile.serverDirectory & cffile.serverFile);
  throw(message="Disallowed file type.");
}
```

3. **Store uploads outside the web root** when files should not be directly browsable. Serve them through a CF endpoint that checks permissions first.

::

## Activity 2 — Create a file upload handler

**Activity:** Create `upload_media.cfm` — a page with a `cffile` upload handler and a form that accepts video and audio files:

```bash
sudo mkdir -p /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/uploads/media

sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/upload_media.cfm << 'EOF'
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">

  <style>
    body { font-family: sans-serif; max-width: 520px; margin: 2rem auto; }
    .result { margin-top: 1rem; padding: 1rem; background: #f0f4ff; border-left: 4px solid #3b82d4; }
    .error  { color: #c0392b; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>Upload Media File</h1>

<cfif cgi.REQUEST_METHOD eq "POST" and structKeyExists(form, "mediaFile") and len(form.mediaFile)>
  <cfscript>
    allowedTypes = "video/mp4,video/webm,audio/mpeg,audio/ogg";
    allowedExts  = ["mp4", "webm", "mp3", "ogg"];
    uploadDir    = expandPath("/uploads/media/");

    try {
      cffile(
        action       = "upload",
        filefield    = "mediaFile",
        destination  = uploadDir,
        accept       = allowedTypes,
        nameconflict = "makeunique"
      );
      ext = lCase(listLast(cffile.serverFile, "."));
      if (!arrayFind(allowedExts, ext)) {
        fileDelete(cffile.serverDirectory & "/" & cffile.serverFile);
        throw(message="Disallowed file extension: #ext#");
      }
    } catch (any e) {
      uploadError = e.message;
    }
  </cfscript>

  <cfif isDefined("uploadError")>
    <div class="result"><span class="error">Upload failed: <cfoutput>#encodeForHTML(uploadError)#</cfoutput></span></div>
  <cfelse>
    <div class="result">
      <strong>Upload successful!</strong><br>
      <cfoutput>
        File: <strong>#encodeForHTML(cffile.serverFile)#</strong><br>
        Size: <strong>#cffile.fileSize# bytes</strong><br>
        Type: <strong>#encodeForHTML(cffile.contentType)#</strong>
      </cfoutput>
    </div>
  </cfif>
</cfif>

  <form method="post" enctype="multipart/form-data">
    <label for="mediaFile">Choose a video or audio file:</label><br><br>
    <input type="file" id="mediaFile" name="mediaFile" accept="video/*,audio/*" required>
    <br><br>
    <button type="submit">Upload</button>
  </form>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

Verify the upload handler is accessible:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8500/upload_media.cfm
```

You should see `200`.

## Image manipulation with cfimage

ColdFusion ships with a built-in image manipulation library — no external dependencies needed:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  // Resize an uploaded image to a 200×200 thumbnail
  cfimage(
    action      = "resize",
    source      = "/uploads/original.jpg",
    destination = "/uploads/thumb.jpg",
    width       = "200",
    height      = "200",
    overwrite   = true
  );
</cfscript>
```

:alt: Grid of six labelled boxes showing cfimage actions — resize (thumbnail icon), rotate (circular arrow with degree label), convert (two file extension labels jpg↔png), addBorder (image with thick border), watermark (semi-transparent text overlaid on a photo), and captcha (distorted text challenge image) — each box has the action name in bold and a one-line description below
:max-width: 860px
---
_`cfimage` actions reference — resize, rotate, convert, addBorder, watermark, and captcha all ship in the core runtime._
::

All `cfimage` actions:

| Action | What it does |
|---|---|
| `resize` | Scale image to new dimensions |
| `rotate` | Rotate by degrees |
| `convert` | Change format (e.g. JPG → PNG) |
| `addBorder` | Add a coloured border |
| `watermark` | Overlay semi-transparent text or image |
| `captcha` | Generate a CAPTCHA challenge image |
| `read` | Load image into a CF image object for scripted manipulation |
| `write` | Save a CF image object to disk |
| `getInfo` | Return width, height, format, and EXIF metadata |

---

## Activity 3 — Generate a thumbnail with cfimage

**Activity:** Create `image_thumb.cfm` — a page that uses `cfimage` to generate a thumbnail from a small test image and display both the original and the resized result:

```bash
# Create a minimal test image using ColdFusion itself
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/image_thumb.cfm << 'EOF'
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">

    body { font-family: sans-serif; max-width: 700px; margin: 2rem auto; }
    .images { display: flex; gap: 2rem; align-items: flex-start; margin-top: 1rem; }
    figure  { margin: 0; text-align: center; }
    figcaption { font-size: .85rem; color: #555; margin-top: .4rem; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>cfimage — Thumbnail Demo</h1>

  <cfscript>
    srcPath   = expandPath("/uploads/test_original.jpg");
    thumbPath = expandPath("/uploads/test_thumb.jpg");

    // Generate a solid-colour test image if it doesn't exist yet
    if (!fileExists(srcPath)) {
      img = imageNew("", 400, 300, "rgb", "##4a90d9");
      imageSetDrawingColor(img, "white");
      imageDrawText(img, "ColdFusion Test Image  400x300", 60, 145);
      imageWrite(img, srcPath);
    }

    // Resize to 200×150 thumbnail
    cfimage(
      action      = "resize",
      source      = srcPath,
      destination = thumbPath,
      width       = "200",
      height      = "150",
      overwrite   = true
    );

    origImg   = imageRead(srcPath);
    thumbImg  = imageRead(thumbPath);
    origInfo  = imageInfo(origImg);
    thumbInfo = imageInfo(thumbImg);
  </cfscript>

  <div class="images">
    <figure>
      <img src="/uploads/test_original.jpg" width="400" height="300" alt="Original">
      <figcaption>
        <cfoutput>Original — #origInfo.width#×#origInfo.height# px</cfoutput>

  </div>
</body>
</html>
EOF
```

Open `/image_thumb.cfm` in the **ColdFusion 2025** browser tab. ColdFusion will generate the test image programmatically and display both original and thumbnail side by side.

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8500/image_thumb.cfm
```

:summary: Troubleshooting — "Variable IMAGEGETINFO is undefined"

If you see this error when loading `image_thumb.cfm`:

::image-box

:src: __static__/error-ocurred-cfimage-v1.png
:alt: ColdFusion error page showing "Variable IMAGEGETINFO is undefined" with the standard CF error layout
:max-width: 860px
---
_ColdFusion 2025 error — `imageGetInfo()` does not exist as a standalone function._
::

**What it means:** an earlier version of this lesson used `imageGetInfo()`, which does not exist in ColdFusion 2025. The correct function is `imageInfo()`.

**The fix** — use `imageInfo()` on an image object returned by `imageRead()`:

```cfml
// ✗ Wrong — imageGetInfo() is not a CF2025 function
origInfo = imageGetInfo(imageRead(srcPath));

// ✓ Correct
origImg  = imageRead(srcPath);
origInfo = imageInfo(origImg);
writeOutput(origInfo.width & "×" & origInfo.height);
```

The current code in this lesson already uses `imageInfo()`. If you see this error it means you are running an older copy of `image_thumb.cfm` — re-run the `sudo tee` command above to replace it with the corrected version.
