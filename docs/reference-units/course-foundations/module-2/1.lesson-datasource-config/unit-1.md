The `training_db` datasource is pre-configured in CF Admin on first boot. It is an embedded H2 database pre-seeded with a **Help Desk schema**.

::hint-box
---
:summary: What is an embedded H2 database?
---

**H2** is a relational database engine written entirely in Java. "Embedded" means it runs **inside the same JVM process as ColdFusion** — there is no separate database server to install, start, or connect to over a network. The database file lives on disk alongside the application.

**Why H2 for training?**

| Property | H2 (embedded) | MySQL / PostgreSQL (external) |
|---|---|---|
| Setup | Zero — ships with ColdFusion | Requires a separate install and service |
| Network | None — in-process | TCP connection to a server |
| Performance | Fast for small datasets | Optimised for production workloads |
| Persistence | File on disk | Dedicated server storage |
| Use case | Development, testing, training | Production applications |

H2 supports a large subset of standard SQL — `SELECT`, `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, `DELETE`, joins, indexes, transactions — so everything you learn querying `training_db` transfers directly to MySQL or PostgreSQL.

**How ColdFusion connects to it:**
ColdFusion uses a JDBC driver (`h2-*.jar`, bundled in the CF installation) to open the embedded database file. The datasource definition in CF Admin points to that file path. When CF starts, H2 opens the file and keeps it ready for queries — no separate `service start` command needed.

**In production you would use an external database.** H2 is not recommended for production because it does not support the same level of concurrent write throughput, replication, or operational tooling as MySQL, PostgreSQL, or Microsoft SQL Server. But for learning CFML and SQL, it is ideal — it is always on, always fast, and requires zero administration.

::

| Name | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `training_db` | H2 embedded | All lab exercises |

### Help Desk schema

| Table | Rows | Contents |
|---|---|---|
| `hd_departments` | 4 | IT, Dev, HR, Finance |
| `hd_users` | 6 | Admin, agents, end users |
| `hd_tickets` | 10 | Mixed status, priority, category |
| `hd_comments` | 9 | Thread replies and internal notes |

Useful URLs in your environment:

```
http://localhost:8500/seed-db.cfm   ← re-seed the schema
http://localhost:8500/db-test.cfm   ← view raw table data
```

## What is a datasource?

A ColdFusion datasource is a **named JDBC connection pool**. Pages and components reference it by name — not by connection string. The pool is configured once (in CF Admin or `Application.cfc`) and shared across all requests.

---

## SQL in ColdFusion

ColdFusion passes SQL directly to the underlying database engine — it does not invent its own query language. This means the full power of SQL is available inside `cfquery` and `queryExecute()`.

::details-box
---
:summary: Access the H2 database directly from the terminal (H2 Shell)
---

You can query `training_db` directly using the H2 command-line shell — useful for exploring the schema or testing SQL without writing a `.cfm` file.

**Why ColdFusion must be stopped first:**
H2 in embedded mode uses a file-based lock — when ColdFusion starts, it opens the database file and holds an exclusive lock on it for as long as the server is running. This is the same model used by SQLite. If you try to connect a second process (the H2 shell) while CF is running, H2 detects the lock and refuses the connection with an `AccessDeniedException`. Stopping CF releases the lock, allowing the shell to open the file exclusively. This is a fundamental characteristic of embedded databases — they trade multi-process access for simplicity and zero administration. In production you would use a server-mode database (MySQL, PostgreSQL) which allows unlimited concurrent connections from any process.

**Step 1 — Stop ColdFusion:**

```bash
sudo /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/bin/coldfusion stop
```

**Step 2 — Open the H2 shell:**

```bash
sudo /opt/coldfusion2025/jre/bin/java \
  -cp /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/lib/h2-2.2.224.jar \
  org.h2.tools.Shell \
  -url "jdbc:h2:/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/db/training_db" \
  -user sa \
  -password ""
```

**Step 3 — Run SQL at the prompt:**

```sql
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT id, full_name, role FROM hd_users;
SELECT id, title, status, priority FROM hd_tickets ORDER BY id;
exit
```

::image-box

_H2 Shell connected to `training_db` — full SQL access from the terminal._
::

**Step 4 — Restart ColdFusion when done:**

```bash
sudo /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/bin/coldfusion start
```

**Alternative — no restart needed:** use the CF Admin query tool at `http://localhost:8500/CFIDE/administrator` → **Data & Services → Data Sources** → click `training_db` → **Actions → Query**. This runs SQL against the live database while ColdFusion stays running.

::

**ANSI SQL compliance:** ColdFusion is ANSI SQL-92 compliant through the JDBC driver of the target database. H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQL Server all support the ANSI standard with their own extensions. Write standard SQL and it works across all of them; use vendor-specific syntax (e.g. `TOP` for MSSQL, `LIMIT` for MySQL/PostgreSQL) when you need database-specific features.

**How complex can a query be?** As complex as the database engine supports — ColdFusion simply passes the SQL string to JDBC. All of the following work inside `cfquery`:

```cfml
<cfquery name="dashboard" datasource="training_db">
  SELECT
    d.name                          AS department,
    COUNT(t.id)                     AS total_tickets,
    SUM(CASE WHEN t.status = 'open'     THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS open_count,
    SUM(CASE WHEN t.status = 'closed'   THEN 1 ELSE 0 END) AS closed_count,
    AVG(DATEDIFF('HOUR', t.created_at, COALESCE(t.closed_at, NOW()))) AS avg_hours
  FROM       hd_departments d
  LEFT JOIN  hd_tickets     t ON t.department_id = d.id
  LEFT JOIN  hd_users       u ON t.assigned_to   = u.id
  WHERE      t.created_at >= DATEADD('DAY', -30, NOW())
  GROUP BY   d.id, d.name
  HAVING     COUNT(t.id) > 0
  ORDER BY   open_count DESC
</cfquery>
```

This single query uses `LEFT JOIN`, `CASE WHEN`, `AVG`, `DATEDIFF`, `COALESCE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, and `ORDER BY` — all standard SQL, all work in H2 and transfer directly to MySQL or PostgreSQL.

::hint-box
---
:summary: Joins, subqueries, CTEs, nested queries — what's supported?
---

**JOINs** — all standard join types work:

```cfml
<cfquery name="tickets" datasource="training_db">
  SELECT t.title, u.name AS assigned_to, d.name AS department
  FROM   hd_tickets     t
  JOIN   hd_users       u ON t.assigned_to   = u.id
  JOIN   hd_departments d ON t.department_id = d.id
  WHERE  t.status = 'open'
</cfquery>
```

**Subqueries** — a `SELECT` inside a `WHERE` or `FROM` clause:

```cfml
<cfquery name="highPriority" datasource="training_db">
  SELECT title, priority
  FROM   hd_tickets
  WHERE  id IN (
    SELECT ticket_id
    FROM   hd_comments
    WHERE  is_internal = 1
  )
</cfquery>
```

**CTEs (Common Table Expressions)** — supported in H2, MySQL 8+, PostgreSQL, MSSQL:

```cfml
<cfquery name="summary" datasource="training_db">
  WITH open_tickets AS (
    SELECT department_id, COUNT(*) AS cnt
    FROM   hd_tickets
    WHERE  status = 'open'
    GROUP  BY department_id
  )
  SELECT d.name, ot.cnt
  FROM   hd_departments d
  JOIN   open_tickets   ot ON d.id = ot.department_id
  ORDER  BY ot.cnt DESC
</cfquery>
```

**Nested `cfquery` (query of queries):** ColdFusion has a feature called **Query of Queries (QoQ)** — you can run SQL against the result of a previous `cfquery` entirely in memory, without hitting the database again:

```cfml
<!--- First query hits the database --->
<cfquery name="allTickets" datasource="training_db">
  SELECT id, title, priority, status FROM hd_tickets
</cfquery>

<!--- Second query runs against the in-memory result — no DB hit --->
<cfquery name="criticalOnly" dbtype="query">
  SELECT * FROM allTickets
  WHERE priority = 'critical'
  ORDER BY id DESC
</cfquery>

<cfoutput query="criticalOnly">
  #title# (#status#)<br>
</cfoutput>
```

The key is `dbtype="query"` instead of `datasource="..."` — this tells ColdFusion to treat the named query result as a table.

**Dynamic SQL with `cfqueryparam`:** always use `cfqueryparam` for any variable in a query — it prevents SQL injection and enables prepared statement caching:

```cfml
<cfquery name="byStatus" datasource="training_db">
  SELECT id, title FROM hd_tickets
  WHERE status    = <cfqueryparam value="#status#"    cfsqltype="cf_sql_varchar">
  AND   priority  = <cfqueryparam value="#priority#"  cfsqltype="cf_sql_varchar">
</cfquery>
```

Never interpolate variables directly into SQL strings — `WHERE status = '#status#'` is a SQL injection vulnerability.

## Configure in CF Admin

The `training_db` datasource is already set up — no manual steps needed. To inspect it:

1. Browse to `http://localhost:8500/CFIDE/administrator`
2. Log in with password: `admin`
3. Go to **Data & Services → Data Sources**
4. Click **Verify** next to `training_db`

You should see a green checkmark and "OK" status.

:summary: What else is under Data & Services in CF Admin?
---

The **Data & Services** section of CF Admin is the central hub for configuring every type of external data connection and service integration ColdFusion supports. This course focuses on **Data Sources** — the others are covered in depth in the Advanced ColdFusion courses.

| Option | What it configures | Used with |
|---|---|---|
| **Data Sources** | Named JDBC connection pools to relational databases (H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, Oracle) | `cfquery`, `queryExecute()`, ORM |
| **NoSQL Sources** | Connections to MongoDB document stores | `cfmongodb`, custom Java integration |
| **ColdFusion Collections** | Verity full-text search indexes — collections of documents indexed for keyword search | `cfindex`, `cfsearch` |
| **Solr Server** | Connection to an Apache Solr search server for enterprise full-text search | `cfindex`, `cfsearch` with Solr engine |
| **Web Services** | Registered WSDL endpoints for SOAP web service consumption | `cfinvoke`, `cfobject` |
| **REST Services** | Registered ColdFusion REST applications — maps URL paths to CFC-based REST endpoints | `cfrestregistry`, REST CFCs with `restpath` |
| **PDF Service** | Connection to a remote ColdFusion PDF generation service for offloading heavy PDF rendering | `cfdocument`, `cfpdf` with remote engine |
| **Cloud Credentials** | Stored credentials for AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud services (S3, SES, Rekognition, etc.) | `cffile` S3 storage, `cfmail` SES, AI/ML tags |
| **Cloud Configuration** | Named cloud storage and service configurations that reference a Cloud Credential | `cffile action="copy"` to S3, cloud functions |
| **GraphQL** | Schema registration and endpoint configuration for ColdFusion's built-in GraphQL support | GraphQL query execution via ColdFusion endpoints |

**A note on scope:** this lesson covers Data Sources only, because relational databases are the backbone of almost every ColdFusion application. The other integrations — Solr, SOAP, REST, PDF, cloud services, and GraphQL — each have their own dedicated lessons in the **Advanced ColdFusion** course track where they are explored hands-on with real examples.

## Activity 1 — Verify the datasource with CFML

**Activity:** Click the **Terminal** tab in your lab. Copy and paste the script below to create `verify_ds.cfm` — a page that queries `training_db` and outputs a connection confirmation:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/verify_ds.cfm << 'EOF'
<cfquery name="test" datasource="training_db">
  SELECT COUNT(*) AS total FROM hd_tickets
</cfquery>
<cfoutput>Connection OK — #test.total# tickets found</cfoutput>
EOF
```

Verify the page responds correctly:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/verify_ds.cfm
# Expected: Connection OK — 10 tickets found
```

::image-box

## Activity 2 — Inspect the datasource in CF Admin

**Activity:** Open the **ColdFusion 2025** browser tab and navigate to the CF Administrator to inspect `training_db`:

1. Browse to `http://localhost:8500/CFIDE/administrator`
2. Log in with password: `admin`
3. Go to **Data & Services → Data Sources**
4. Locate the `training_db` row and click **Verify**
5. Confirm the status column shows a green checkmark and **OK**

## Activity 3 — Define the datasource in Application.cfc

**Activity:** Setting `this.datasource` in `Application.cfc` makes `training_db` the default for every `cfquery` call in your application — no need to repeat the `datasource` attribute on each tag.

In the **Terminal** tab, create `Application.cfc` in the web root:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc << 'EOF'
component {

  this.name       = "HelpdeskApp";
  this.datasource = "training_db";

}
EOF
```

Verify the file was written correctly:

```bash
grep "this.datasource" /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc
# Expected: this.datasource = "training_db";
```

## Activity 4 — Query of Queries (QoQ)

**Activity:** Create `qoq_demo.cfm` — a page that fetches all tickets from the database in one query, then uses ColdFusion's Query of Queries feature to filter and sort the results **in memory** without a second database hit:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/qoq_demo.cfm << 'EOF'

- All 10 tickets from the database
- A filtered list of **open + high priority** tickets — expect 2 rows: **Cannot connect to VPN** and **Payroll export failing**
- A status summary grouped by status (open, in_progress, resolved) — all derived from the same in-memory result set
