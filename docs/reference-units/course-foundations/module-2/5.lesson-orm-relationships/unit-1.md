## ORM entity mapping in detail

The ORM basics lesson introduced a simple `Ticket.cfc` with a handful of properties. This lesson goes deeper — looking at the full set of mapping attributes available on `cfcomponent` and `cfproperty`, then building on that foundation to define relationships between entities.

### cfcomponent mapping attributes

| Attribute | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `persistent` | `false` | **Required.** Set `true` to make this CFC an ORM entity |
| `entityname` | CFC file name | The name Hibernate uses internally — used in HQL queries and `EntityLoad` calls |
| `table` | entityname | The database table this entity maps to |
| `schema` | — | Database schema name |
| `catalog` | — | Database catalog name |
| `lazy` | `true` | Whether instances are loaded lazily when navigating associations |
| `batchsize` | — | Number of entities to batch-load at once when lazy-loading |
| `dynamicupdate` | `false` | Only include changed columns in the `UPDATE` SQL — useful for wide tables |
| `dynamicinsert` | `false` | Only include non-null columns in the `INSERT` SQL |
| `readonly` | `false` | If `true`, no insert/update/delete is ever issued — useful for views |
| `discriminatorvalue` | entityname | Used in table-per-hierarchy inheritance |
| `discriminatorcolumn` | — | Column that distinguishes subclasses in a single-table hierarchy |

### cfproperty mapping attributes

```cfml
// Artist.cfc — full mapping example
component persistent="true" entityname="Artist" table="Artists" {
  property name="id"          column="ARTISTID"   fieldtype="id"  generator="increment";
  property name="firstname";
  property name="lastname";
  property name="address";
  property name="city";
  property name="state";
  property name="postalcode";
  property name="email";
  property name="phone";
  property name="fax";
  property name="thepassword";
}
```

Key points in this example:
- `entityname="Artist"` — the name used in HQL (`FROM Artist`) and `EntityLoad("Artist", ...)`, which can differ from the CFC filename
- `table="Artists"` — maps to the `Artists` database table (different from the entityname)
- `column="ARTISTID"` on the `id` property — maps to the actual database column name `ARTISTID` rather than the default `id`
- `generator="increment"` — Hibernate manages the PK sequence itself (use `"native"` to delegate to the database's AUTO_INCREMENT)
- Properties without attributes (`firstname`, `lastname`, etc.) auto-map to columns with the same name

:summary: cfproperty column-mapping attributes reference
---

| Attribute | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | — | **Required.** Property name — used for getter/setter names |
| `column` | property name | Override the database column name (useful when names differ) |
| `fieldtype` | `column` | `column`, `id`, `version`, `timestamp`, `one-to-one`, `one-to-many`, `many-to-one`, `many-to-many` |
| `ormtype` | `string` | Data type: `string`, `integer`, `long`, `float`, `double`, `boolean`, `date`, `timestamp`, `text`, `binary` |
| `generator` | `native` | PK generation strategy: `native`, `increment`, `identity`, `sequence`, `foreign`, `assigned` |
| `length` | — | Column length — adds a `VARCHAR(n)` constraint when ORM creates the table |
| `notnull` | `false` | Adds a NOT NULL constraint |
| `unique` | `false` | Adds a UNIQUE constraint |
| `default` | — | Default value inserted when no value is set |
| `dbdefault` | — | Default value at the database level |
| `insert` | `true` | Include this column in INSERT statements |
| `update` | `true` | Include this column in UPDATE statements — set `false` for created-at timestamps |
| `optimisticlock` | `true` | Whether changes to this property acquire an optimistic lock |
| `lazy` | `false` | Load this property lazily (useful for `text`/`binary` large-value columns) |
| `formula` | — | A SQL expression evaluated as a computed column — read-only |

## Working with ORM objects

Once your entities are defined you interact with them using ColdFusion's built-in ORM functions. These functions wrap Hibernate's session API in a simple ColdFusion interface.

### EntityNew — create an object without saving

`EntityNew(entityName)` creates a new instance of the entity in memory without touching the database:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  artist = EntityNew("Artist");
  artist.setFirstname("Georgia");
  artist.setLastname("O'Keeffe");
  artist.setCity("Abiquiú");
  artist.setState("NM");
  // Not yet in the database — no SQL issued yet
</cfscript>
```

You can also pass an initial struct of values as the second argument:

```cfml
artist = EntityNew("Artist", { firstname: "Frida", lastname: "Kahlo", city: "Mexico City" });
```

### EntitySave — persist an object

`EntitySave(entity)` issues an `INSERT` for new objects and an `UPDATE` for objects loaded from the database. Hibernate's **dirty checking** means `EntitySave` on an already-loaded object only issues an `UPDATE` if a property actually changed:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  // INSERT — new object
  employee = EntityNew("Employee");
  employee.setFirstName("Tom");
  employee.setLastName("Jones");
  employee.setSalary(100000);
  employee.setContract("Y");
  EntitySave(employee);

  // UPDATE — loaded object
  employee.setSalary(125000);
  EntitySave(employee);   // issues UPDATE only for the salary column
</cfscript>
```

### EntityLoadByPK — load a single record by primary key

`EntityLoadByPK(entityName, pkValue)` returns the entity whose primary key matches `pkValue`, or `null` if no row is found:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  employee = EntityLoadByPK("Employee", 1958);
  if (isNull(employee)) {
    writeOutput("No employee with that ID");
  } else {
    writeOutput(employee.getFirstName() & " " & employee.getLastName());
  }
</cfscript>
```

### EntityLoad — load a collection

`EntityLoad(entityName)` returns all rows. Pass a struct as the second argument to filter by property values:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  // All employees
  all = EntityLoad("Employee");

  // Only employees in New York, ordered by lastname
  nyEmployees = EntityLoad("Employee", { city: "New York" }, "lastname asc");
</cfscript>
```

### EntityDelete — remove a record

`EntityDelete(entity)` deletes the row from the database. You must first load the object with `EntityLoadByPK`:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  employee = EntityLoadByPK("Employee", 1958);
  EntityDelete(employee);
  // Row with PK 1958 is now deleted from the Employee table
</cfscript>
```

::hint-box
---
:summary: Always load before you delete — never pass an un-loaded object to EntityDelete
---

`EntityDelete` requires a **managed entity** — an object that Hibernate is tracking in the current session. Passing a manually constructed object (not loaded via `EntityLoad` or `EntityLoadByPK`) will throw a `TransientObjectException`.

If you need to delete by PK, always call `EntityLoadByPK` first:

```cfml
// CORRECT
toDelete = EntityLoadByPK("Ticket", 42);
if (!isNull(toDelete)) EntityDelete(toDelete);

// WRONG — throws TransientObjectException
fake = new Ticket();
fake.setId(42);
EntityDelete(fake);   // ✗
```

::

### Getters and setters — auto-generated methods

ColdFusion generates `get<PropertyName>()` and `set<PropertyName>()` methods for every `cfproperty`. You never write these yourself:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  artist = EntityLoadByPK("Artist", 1);
  // Auto-generated getters
  name     = artist.getFirstname();    // → "Georgia"
  city     = artist.getCity();         // → "Abiquiú"

  // Auto-generated setters
  artist.setEmail("g@example.com");
  artist.setPhone("505-555-0100");
  EntitySave(artist);
</cfscript>
```

You can override these methods in the CFC body if you need custom behaviour — your implementation takes precedence over the generated one.

### ORMReload — reload after config changes

Hibernate builds its session factory when the application starts. If you change `Application.cfc` ORM settings or add/modify a persistent CFC, call `ORMReload()` to rebuild the session factory without restarting ColdFusion:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  ORMReload();   // rebuilds the Hibernate session factory
  employees = EntityLoad("Employee");
  writeDump(employees);
</cfscript>
```

::hint-box
---
:summary: When to call ORMReload — and when not to
---

Call `ORMReload()` when:
- You added a new persistent CFC
- You changed `cfcomponent` or `cfproperty` mapping attributes
- You changed `ormsettings` in `Application.cfc`
- You renamed an entity or changed `table`/`column` attributes

**Do NOT call `ORMReload()` on every page request.** It is expensive — it discards the Hibernate session factory and rebuilds it from scratch. In production the session factory is built once at application start. `ORMReload()` is a development tool only.

If you need `ORMReload()` in a CFM page during development, place it inside a condition:

```cfml
if (structKeyExists(url, "reload")) ORMReload();
```

Access the page with `?reload=1` when you need it, normal requests skip it.

## Why relationships matter in ORM

In a relational database, tables are linked via **foreign keys**. In an object model, the same connections are expressed as **associations** — one object holds a reference (or a collection of references) to another.

ColdFusion Hibernate ORM lets you declare those associations directly on `cfproperty` using the `fieldtype` attribute. Once declared, Hibernate manages the SQL JOINs, lazy loading, and cascaded saves/deletes automatically.

::details-box
---
:summary: Key concepts — source, target, direction, and multiplicity
---

Before writing any code it helps to understand the vocabulary:

| Term | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Source object** | The object that holds the reference to the related object |
| **Target object** | The object being referred to |
| **Unidirectional** | Only the source knows about the target; the target has no reference back |
| **Bidirectional** | Both objects hold a reference to each other |
| **Multiplicity** | How many objects can be on each side — one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-one, many-to-many |

**Bidirectional example — Person and Address:**

```cfml
// Make the association bidirectional
person.setAddress(address);   // person → address (unidirectional so far)
address.setPerson(person);    // address → person (now bidirectional)
```

In a bidirectional relationship one side must set `inverse="true"` to avoid Hibernate writing the relationship twice to the database (see the Inverse section below).

::

---

## The four relationship types

Set `fieldtype` on `cfproperty` to one of:

| fieldtype | When to use |
|---|---|
| `one-to-one` | Each source has exactly one target, and vice-versa |
| `one-to-many` | One source has many targets (source holds a collection) |
| `many-to-one` | Many sources reference the same target (foreign key on source table) |
| `many-to-many` | Both sides hold collections — requires a link table |

_The four ORM relationship types — each maps directly to a `fieldtype` value on `cfproperty`._
::

---

## One-to-one relationships

A one-to-one relationship means the source object has one, and only one, associated target object.

**Example:** An `Employee` has one `OfficeCubicle`.

There are two variants:

### Primary key association

Both tables share the same primary key. The dependent table's PK is a foreign key to the primary table's PK.

```cfml
// Employee.cfc
component persistent="true" table="Employee" {
  property name="id"             fieldtype="id"       generator="native";
  property name="firstname";
  property name="lastname";
  property name="officecubicle"  fieldtype="one-to-one" cfc="OfficeCubicle";
}
```

```cfml
// OfficeCubicle.cfc  — PK is a foreign key to Employee.id
component persistent="true" table="OfficeCubicle" {
  property name="id"       fieldtype="id"       generator="foreign"
                           params="{property='Employee'}" ormtype="int";
  property name="Employee" fieldtype="one-to-one" cfc="Employee" constrained="true";
  property name="Location";
  property name="Size";
}
```

`constrained="true"` on the `OfficeCubicle` side means the OfficeCubicle table's PK has a foreign-key constraint referencing the Employee PK. `generator="foreign"` tells Hibernate to copy the PK value from the related `Employee` object rather than generating a new one.

### Unique foreign key association

The dependent table has its own auto-generated PK plus a unique foreign key column pointing to the other table.

```cfml
// Employee.cfc — the "mappedby" side
component persistent="true" table="Employee" {
  property name="EmployeeID"    fieldtype="id"       generator="native";
  property name="firstname";
  property name="lastname";
  property name="officecubicle" fieldtype="one-to-one" cfc="OfficeCubicle"
                                mappedby="Employee";
}
```

```cfml
// OfficeCubicle.cfc — holds the FK column
component persistent="true" table="OfficeCubicle" {
  property name="id"       fieldtype="id"       generator="native";
  property name="Employee" fieldtype="one-to-one" cfc="Employee"
                           fkcolumn="EmployeeID";
  property name="Location";
  property name="Size";
}
```

`fkcolumn="EmployeeID"` identifies the foreign key column in `OfficeCubicle`. The `Employee` side uses `mappedby="Employee"` to point back to that property — `fkcolumn` must **not** be specified on the `mappedby` side.

---

## One-to-many relationships

A one-to-many relationship means one source object is associated with a **collection** of target objects. The foreign key lives in the **target** table and points back to the source.

**Example:** One `Artist` has many `Art` pieces.

ColdFusion supports the collection as either an **array** or a **struct**.

### Array collection

```cfml
// Artist.cfc
component persistent="true" table="Artists" {
  property name="id"   fieldtype="id" generator="native";
  property name="name";
  property name="art"  fieldtype="one-to-many" cfc="Art"
                       fkcolumn="ARTISTID" type="array";
}
```

```cfml
// Art.cfc
component persistent="true" table="Art" {
  property name="id"       fieldtype="id"      generator="native";
  property name="title";
  property name="issold"   ormtype="boolean";
  property name="artist"   fieldtype="many-to-one" cfc="Artist"
                           fkcolumn="ARTISTID";
}
```

- `fkcolumn="ARTISTID"` — the foreign key column in the `Art` table that references `Artists.id`
- `type="array"` — the `artist.getArt()` method returns an array of `Art` objects

### Struct collection

```cfml
property name="art" fieldtype="one-to-many" cfc="Art" fkcolumn="ARTISTID"
         type="struct" structkeycolumn="ArtID" structkeytype="int";
```

`structkeycolumn` specifies which column in the target table to use as the struct key.

### Filtering the collection

Use the `where` attribute to load only a subset of associated objects:

```cfml
// Only unsold artwork for this artist
property name="unsoldArts" cfc="Art" fieldtype="one-to-many"
         fkcolumn="ARTISTID" where="issold=0";
```

::hint-box
---
:summary: Lazy loading — collections are not loaded until accessed
---

By default (`lazy="true"`), Hibernate does **not** hit the database when you load an `Artist`. The `Art` collection is fetched only when you call `artist.getArt()` for the first time. This avoids loading large collections you may not need.

Set `lazy="false"` to load the collection immediately with a JOIN — useful when you always need the related objects and want to avoid the extra query.

Set `lazy="extra"` for very large collections — individual items are loaded on demand rather than all at once.

::

---

## Many-to-one relationships

A many-to-one relationship is the inverse of one-to-many. Many source objects reference the same target object. The foreign key lives in the **source** table.

**Example:** Many `Art` pieces belong to one `Artist`.

```cfml
// Art.cfc
component persistent="true" table="Art" {
  property name="id"     fieldtype="id"       generator="native";
  property name="title";
  property name="artist" fieldtype="many-to-one" cfc="Artist"
                         fkcolumn="ARTISTID";
}
```

`fkcolumn="ARTISTID"` is the column in the `Art` table that holds the foreign key to `Artists`.

In practice, **many-to-one and one-to-many are two sides of the same relationship**. Declare `many-to-one` on the child (the table holding the FK) and `one-to-many` on the parent (the table whose PK is referenced).

---

## Many-to-many relationships

A many-to-many relationship means both sides hold collections of each other. It requires a **link table** containing foreign keys to both participating tables.

**Example:** An `Order` has many `Product` objects, and a `Product` appears in many `Order` objects. The link table `Order_Product` holds `(orderId, productId)` pairs.

```cfml
// Order.cfc
component persistent="true" table="Orders" {
  property name="id"       fieldtype="id" generator="native";
  property name="products" fieldtype="many-to-many" cfc="Product"
                           linktable="Order_Product"
                           fkcolumn="orderId"
                           inversejoincolumn="productId"
                           cascade="all"
                           lazy="true"
                           orderby="productId";
}
```

```cfml
// Product.cfc
component persistent="true" table="Products" {
  property name="id"     fieldtype="id" generator="native";
  property name="name";
  property name="orders" fieldtype="many-to-many" cfc="Order"
                         linktable="Order_Product"
                         fkcolumn="productId"
                         inversejoincolumn="orderId"
                         cascade="all"
                         lazy="true"
                         orderby="orderId";
}
```

- `linktable` — name of the join table
- `fkcolumn` — foreign key in the link table pointing to **this** entity's PK
- `inversejoincolumn` — foreign key in the link table pointing to the **other** entity's PK

| `structkeytype` | one-to-many, many-to-many (struct) | — | Data type of the struct key |

::

---

## Cascade options

Cascade tells Hibernate to automatically apply an operation performed on the **parent** to its **children**.

| Value | What it does |
|---|---|
| `all` | Cascade every operation (save, update, delete, refresh) to child objects |
| `save-update` | Save/update child objects when the parent is saved |
| `delete` | Delete child objects when the parent is deleted |
| `delete-orphan` | Delete children whose association has been removed (one-to-many only) |
| `all-delete-orphan` | `all` + `delete-orphan` — the most common choice for owned collections |
| `refresh` | Cascade the `refresh` action — reloads the child from the database |

```cfml
// Artist owns its Art — deleting the artist removes all art pieces
property name="art" fieldtype="one-to-many" cfc="Art" fkcolumn="ARTISTID"
         cascade="all-delete-orphan";
```

**Rules of thumb:**
- For owned one-to-many collections: use `all-delete-orphan`
- When children can exist independently (e.g. tags shared across many records): use `save-update`
- Avoid `cascade` on `many-to-one` and `many-to-many` — it can cause unintended deletes

---

## Inverse

In a **bidirectional** relationship both sides reference each other. Without `inverse`, Hibernate would issue SQL to persist the association **twice** — once from each side. Use `inverse="true"` on one side to tell Hibernate to ignore that side when generating SQL.

**Rule:** Set `inverse="true"` on the **one-to-many** side (the parent's collection property). The **many-to-one** side (the child that holds the FK column) is the authoritative side.

```cfml
// Artist.cfc — parent — set inverse here
property name="art" fieldtype="one-to-many" cfc="Art"
         fkcolumn="ARTISTID" inverse="true" cascade="all-delete-orphan";
```

```cfml
// Art.cfc — child — owns the FK column, so this side persists the link
property name="artist" fieldtype="many-to-one" cfc="Artist"
         fkcolumn="ARTISTID";
```

For many-to-many relationships, set `inverse="true"` on either side — just pick one consistently.

## Activity 1 — Define a one-to-many relationship

::hint-box
---
:summary: Prerequisite — ORM must be enabled in Application.cfc
---

This activity requires `ormenabled = true` in `Application.cfc`. If you completed the ORM Basics lesson this is already in place. If not, or if the file was reset, run this first:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc << 'EOF'
component {
  this.name       = "HelpdeskApp";
  this.datasource = "training_db";
  this.ormenabled = true;
  this.ormsettings = {
    datasource : "training_db",
    dbcreate   : "update",
    logsql     : false
  };
}
EOF
```

::

**Activity:** Create `Category.cfc` and update `Ticket.cfc` so that each category has many tickets and each ticket belongs to one category.

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Category.cfc << 'EOF'
component persistent="true" table="hd_categories" {

  property name="id"      fieldtype="id"       generator="native";
  property name="name"    ormtype="string";
  property name="tickets" fieldtype="one-to-many" cfc="Ticket"
                          fkcolumn="category_id" type="array"
                          cascade="all-delete-orphan" inverse="true";

}
EOF
```

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Ticket.cfc << 'EOF'
component persistent="true" table="hd_tickets" {

  property name="id"          fieldtype="id"         generator="native";
  property name="title"       ormtype="string";
  property name="description" ormtype="string";
  property name="status"      ormtype="string"       default="open";
  property name="priority"    ormtype="string"       default="medium";
  property name="userId"      column="USER_ID"       ormtype="integer"  notnull="false";
  property name="category"    fieldtype="many-to-one" cfc="Category"
                              fkcolumn="category_id";

}
EOF
```

Verify the relationship fieldtype is present:

```bash
grep -h "fieldtype" /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Category.cfc \
                    /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Ticket.cfc

## Activity 2 — Test the relationship with a CFM page

**Activity:** Create `orm_rel_test.cfm` to reload ORM, create a category, add a ticket to it, and read the relationship back:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/orm_rel_test.cfm << 'EOF'
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">
  <title>ORM Relationship Test</title>
  <style>
    body  { font-family: sans-serif; max-width: 820px; margin: 2rem auto; }
    .box  { padding: 1rem; background: #f0f4ff; border-left: 4px solid #3b82d4; margin: 1rem 0; }
    table { width: 100%; border-collapse: collapse; margin-top: 1rem; }
    th    { background: #3b82d4; color: #fff; padding: .5rem .75rem; text-align: left; }
    td    { padding: .45rem .75rem; border-bottom: 1px solid #e5e7eb; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>ORM Relationship Test</h1>

  <cfscript>
    ORMReload();

    // Create a Category and a Ticket linked to it
    cat = EntityNew("Category");
    cat.setName("Hardware");
    EntitySave(cat);

    t = EntityNew("Ticket");
    t.setTitle("Monitor flickering");
    t.setStatus("open");
    t.setPriority("high");
    t.setUserId(1);
    t.setCategory(cat);
    EntitySave(t);

    ORMFlush();

    // Navigate the many-to-one: ticket → category
    loaded = EntityLoadByPK("Ticket", t.getId());
    catName = loaded.getCategory().getName();

    // Navigate the one-to-many: category → tickets
    tickets = EntityLoad("Ticket");
  </cfscript>

  <div class="box">
    <strong>Ticket category (many-to-one):</strong>
    <cfoutput>#encodeForHTML(catName)#</cfoutput>
  </div>

  <h2>All Tickets</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><th>ID</th><th>Title</th><th>Priority</th><th>Category</th></tr>
    <cfoutput>
      <cfloop array="#tickets#" index="tk">
        <tr>
          <td>#tk.getId()#</td>
          <td>#encodeForHTML(tk.getTitle())#</td>
          <td>#encodeForHTML(tk.getPriority())#</td>
          <td>
            <cfif isObject(tk.getCategory())>
              #encodeForHTML(tk.getCategory().getName())#
            <cfelse>
              —
            </cfif>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </cfloop>
    </cfoutput>
  </table>

</body>
</html>
EOF
```

Open `/orm_rel_test.cfm` in the **ColdFusion 2025** browser tab. You should see the ticket's category name loaded via the many-to-one association, and the full ticket list with their categories.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/orm_rel_test.cfm | grep -i "hardware"
```

_This error means `Application.cfc` is missing `ormenabled = true` — the fix is one command._
::

This error always means the same thing: `Application.cfc` in the wwwroot does not have `this.ormenabled = true`. It typically happens when:

- You skipped the ORM Basics lesson and `Application.cfc` was never updated
- A previous activity overwrote `Application.cfc` without the ORM settings
- The lab environment was reset

**Fix — run this in the Terminal tab:**

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc << 'EOF'
component {
  this.name       = "HelpdeskApp";
  this.datasource = "training_db";
  this.ormenabled = true;
  this.ormsettings = {
    datasource : "training_db",
    dbcreate   : "update",
    logsql     : false
  };
}
EOF
```

Then reload the page. The `ORMReload()` call at the top of `orm_rel_test.cfm` will reinitialise Hibernate automatically.

## Key takeaways

| Topic | What to remember |
|---|---|
| **entityname vs table** | `entityname` is the name used in HQL and `EntityLoad`; `table` is the database table name — they can differ |
| **column attribute** | Use `column="ARTISTID"` on `cfproperty` to map a property to a differently-named database column |
| **EntityNew** | Creates an in-memory object — no SQL issued until `EntitySave` |
| **EntitySave** | Issues INSERT for new objects, UPDATE for dirty loaded objects — Hibernate's dirty-checking skips unchanged properties |
| **EntityLoadByPK** | Loads a single row by PK — returns `null` if not found, always check with `isNull()` |
| **EntityDelete** | Requires a managed entity loaded via `EntityLoad`/`EntityLoadByPK` — never pass a manually created object |
| **ORMReload** | Rebuilds the session factory — use only in development after changing entity mappings, never on every request |
| **one-to-many FK** | The foreign key lives in the **target** (child) table, not the parent |
| **many-to-one FK** | The foreign key lives in the **source** (child) table — it's the same FK, just seen from the other side |
| **many-to-many link table** | Use `linktable`, `fkcolumn`, and `inversejoincolumn` — the link table has no entity of its own |
| **cascade="all-delete-orphan"** | The standard choice for owned one-to-many collections — deletes children when they are removed from the collection |
| **inverse="true"** | Put on the `one-to-many` side of a bidirectional relationship to prevent Hibernate issuing a duplicate SQL UPDATE |
| **lazy="true" (default)** | Collections are not loaded until accessed — avoids N+1 when you don't need the related objects |
