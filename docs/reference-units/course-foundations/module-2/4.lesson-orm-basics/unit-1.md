## What is ColdFusion ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)?

ColdFusion ships with **Hibernate** as its built-in ORM layer. Mark a CFC as `persistent="true"` and ColdFusion automatically maps it to a database table, generates getter/setter methods, and provides CRUD functions — no SQL DDL required.

:summary: Why use ORM? Real advantages — and honest trade-offs
---

ORM adds a layer of abstraction. That layer has real benefits — but it is not free. Here is an honest breakdown:

**What you genuinely gain:**

| Advantage | Why it matters |
|---|---|
| **Less boilerplate code** | No manual `INSERT`, `UPDATE`, or `SELECT id, title, status FROM...` for every table. `entitySave(t)` handles it. |
| **Schema kept in sync with code** | With `dbcreate="update"`, adding a property to your CFC adds the column to the table automatically — no ALTER TABLE scripts to manage. |
| **Auto-generated getters/setters** | ColdFusion generates `getTitle()`, `setTitle()`, etc. from `property` declarations — one less thing to write. |
| **Object graph navigation** | With relationships defined (one-to-many, many-to-one), you can write `ticket.getAssignee().getEmail()` instead of a JOIN query. |
| **Database portability** | Switch from H2 to MySQL or PostgreSQL by changing the datasource — the same entity code works unchanged. |
| **First-level cache** | Loading the same entity twice in one request hits the database only once — Hibernate returns the cached object automatically. |

**What you do NOT gain (common misconceptions):**

| Misconception | Reality |
|---|---|
| "ORM is faster than SQL" | It is not. ORM-generated SQL is often less optimal than hand-written SQL. For complex reports and aggregates, `cfquery` is faster and easier to tune. |
| "ORM gives you more control" | The opposite — ORM abstracts the SQL away. You have *less* direct control. Use `cfquery` when you need precise SQL. |
| "ORM makes data easier to find" | For simple lookups by PK or a single field, yes. For complex searches across multiple tables, HQL is harder to write and debug than SQL. |
| "ORM eliminates the need to know SQL" | No. You still need to understand SQL to debug ORM-generated queries, tune performance, and write HQL correctly. |

**The honest summary:**
ORM pays off when your application has a clear **domain model** — objects with state and behaviour (a `Ticket` that can be opened, assigned, resolved). It saves time on repetitive CRUD. It pays off *less* when your application is primarily **report-driven** — reading and aggregating data across many tables. Most real ColdFusion applications use both: ORM for domain objects, `cfquery` for reporting and complex queries.

_Hibernate — the most widely used Java ORM framework, bundled inside ColdFusion._
::

**Hibernate** is an open-source Java ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) framework originally released in 2001 by Gavin King. It is now maintained by Red Hat / JBoss and is one of the most widely deployed Java frameworks in the world. ColdFusion has bundled Hibernate since ColdFusion 9 (2009).

**What Hibernate does:**
Hibernate sits between your application code and the database. Instead of writing SQL manually, you define how your objects (CFCs in ColdFusion's case) map to database tables, and Hibernate generates and executes the SQL for you — selects, inserts, updates, deletes, joins, and even schema creation.

**Key Hibernate concepts you will encounter in ColdFusion:**

| Concept | What it means |
|---|---|
| **Entity** | A CFC with `persistent="true"` — maps to one database table |
| **Session** | Hibernate's unit of work — CF manages this per-request automatically |
| **HQL** | Hibernate Query Language — SQL-like but uses entity/property names |
| **Lazy loading** | Related entities are loaded from the DB only when accessed |
| **First-level cache** | Hibernate caches loaded entities within a session — repeated `entityLoadByPK` calls for the same ID don't hit the DB twice |
| **Dirty checking** | Hibernate tracks changes to loaded entities — calling `entitySave()` only issues an UPDATE if properties actually changed |

**Hibernate versions in ColdFusion:**

| CF Version | Hibernate version |
|---|---|
| ColdFusion 9–10 | Hibernate 3.x |
| ColdFusion 11–2016 | Hibernate 4.x |
| ColdFusion 2018–2021 | Hibernate 5.x |
| ColdFusion 2023–2025 | Hibernate 6.x |

**Why does the version matter?** HQL syntax, lazy loading behaviour, and some mapping annotations changed between major versions. If you find older ColdFusion ORM examples online that behave differently, the Hibernate version is usually why.

**Hibernate vs JPA:**
Hibernate implements the **JPA** (Jakarta Persistence API) standard. JPA is the specification; Hibernate is the implementation. ColdFusion exposes Hibernate's native API (`entityLoad`, `ORMExecuteQuery`, etc.) rather than the raw JPA API, but under the hood it is all Hibernate.

_Use ORM for domain-model CRUD, `cfquery` for reporting and complex JOINs — they coexist naturally._
::

| Scenario | Recommendation |
|---|---|
| Simple CRUD on one table | ORM — less boilerplate |
| Complex multi-table JOIN | `cfquery` / `queryExecute` — more control |
| Reporting queries | `cfquery` — easier to optimise |
| Domain model with relationships | ORM — handles lazy loading |

Both can be mixed in the same application — use the right tool for each job.

## Enable ORM in Application.cfc

ORM is disabled by default. Add `this.ormenabled = true` and an `ormsettings` struct to `Application.cfc`:

```cfml
component {
  this.name       = "HelpdeskApp";
  this.datasource = "training_db";
  this.ormenabled = true;
  this.ormsettings = {
    datasource: "training_db",
    dbcreate:   "update",   // "none" | "create" | "update" | "dropcreate"
    logsql:     false
  };
}
```

`dbcreate: "update"` tells Hibernate to alter the schema to match your entities without dropping existing data. Use `"none"` in production once your schema is stable.

::hint-box
---
:summary: What do the dbcreate options mean?
---

| Value | What Hibernate does |
|---|---|
| `none` | Never touches the schema — use in production |
| `create` | Drops and recreates all tables on every app start |
| `update` | Adds missing columns/tables, never drops existing data |
| `dropcreate` | Drops everything and recreates — wipes all data on restart |

**The safe rule for development:** use `update`. It keeps your seed data intact while Hibernate adjusts the schema as you add properties. Switch to `none` before going to production.

::

---

## Define an entity CFC

```cfml
// Ticket.cfc
component persistent="true" table="hd_tickets" {
  property name="id"          fieldtype="id" generator="native";
  property name="title"       ormtype="string";
  property name="description" ormtype="string";
  property name="status"      ormtype="string"  default="open";
  property name="priority"    ormtype="string"  default="medium";
  property name="category"    ormtype="string";
}
```

Each `property` maps to a column. `fieldtype="id"` marks the primary key; `generator="native"` uses the database's auto-increment. ColdFusion generates `getTitle()`, `setTitle()`, etc. automatically.

---

## CRUD operations

```cfml
<cfscript>
  // CREATE
  t = new Ticket();
  t.setTitle("Keyboard not working");
  t.setStatus("open");
  t.setPriority("medium");
  t.setCategory("Hardware");
  entitySave(t);

  // READ — all open tickets
  tickets = entityLoad("Ticket", { status: "open" });

  // READ — single by primary key
  t = entityLoadByPK("Ticket", 1);

  // UPDATE
  t.setStatus("resolved");
  entitySave(t);

  // DELETE
  entityDelete(t);
</cfscript>
```

---

## HQL queries

Hibernate Query Language is SQL-like but operates on **entity names**, not table names:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  // Return all open tickets ordered by id
  openTickets = ORMExecuteQuery(
    "FROM Ticket WHERE status = :status ORDER BY id DESC",
    { status: "open" }
  );

  // Count high priority tickets (unique=true returns a scalar)
  total = ORMExecuteQuery(
    "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Ticket WHERE priority = :p",
    { p: "high" },
    true
  );
</cfscript>
```

::details-box
---
:summary: Hibernate Query Language (HQL) — deep dive
---

**HQL** is an object-oriented query language built into Hibernate. It looks like SQL but operates on **persistent objects and their properties** — never on raw table or column names. At runtime, Hibernate translates HQL into database-specific SQL automatically, so the same HQL works on H2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle without changes.

**What makes HQL different from SQL:**

| SQL | HQL equivalent | What changed |
|---|---|---|
| `FROM student_table` | `FROM Student` | Entity class name, not the table name |
| `WHERE student_table.dept_id = 1` | `WHERE s.department = :dept` | Property name, not the column name |
| `JOIN tickets t ON t.assignee = u.id` | `JOIN t.assignee a` | Navigate object relationships — no ON clause needed |

**Supported clauses and features:**

| Feature | Example |
|---|---|
| Basic select | `FROM Ticket` |
| Filtering | `FROM Ticket WHERE status = :s` |
| Ordering | `FROM Ticket ORDER BY createdAt DESC` |
| Aggregates | `SELECT COUNT(*), AVG(t.id) FROM Ticket t` |
| GROUP BY / HAVING | `SELECT t.priority, COUNT(*) FROM Ticket t GROUP BY t.priority HAVING COUNT(*) > 2` |
| Bulk UPDATE | `UPDATE Ticket SET status = 'closed' WHERE priority = 'low'` |
| Bulk DELETE | `DELETE FROM Ticket WHERE status = 'resolved' AND priority = 'low'` |
| Named parameters | `WHERE id = :id` — safe, reusable, no SQL injection |
| Polymorphic queries | Querying a parent entity returns instances of all mapped subclasses |

**HQL in ColdFusion vs raw Hibernate (Java):**

In Java/Hibernate you call `session.createQuery(hql, Entity.class)` directly. In ColdFusion, the same thing is done with `ORMExecuteQuery()`:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  // Equivalent to: session.createQuery("FROM Ticket t WHERE t.id = :id").setParameter("id", 1).getResultList()
  results = ORMExecuteQuery("FROM Ticket t WHERE t.id = :id", { id: 1 });

  // unique=true → equivalent to getSingleResult() — use for COUNT, MAX, etc.
  total = ORMExecuteQuery("SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Ticket", {}, true);
</cfscript>
```

**HQL vs JPQL:**
HQL is a **superset of JPQL** (Jakarta Persistence Query Language — the JPA standard). Any valid JPQL query is valid HQL, but HQL adds extra features (bulk DML, non-standard functions, Hibernate-specific extensions) that JPQL does not support. If you see JPQL examples online, they will work in ColdFusion ORM unchanged.

**Key things to remember:**
- Always use **named parameters** (`:paramName`) — never concatenate values into an HQL string
- Entity and property names are **case-sensitive** — `FROM ticket` will fail if the entity is named `Ticket`
- HQL operates on the **Hibernate session** — changes made via bulk UPDATE/DELETE bypass dirty-checking and first-level cache; call `ORMClearAllSession()` after bulk operations if you continue loading entities in the same request

## Activity 1 — Enable ORM in Application.cfc

**Activity:** In the **Terminal** tab, update `Application.cfc` to enable Hibernate ORM:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc << 'EOF'
component {

  this.name       = "HelpdeskApp";
  this.datasource = "training_db";
  this.ormenabled = true;
  this.ormsettings = {
    datasource : "training_db",
    dbcreate   : "update",
    logsql     : false
  };

}
EOF
```

Verify `ormenabled` is present:

```bash
grep "ormenabled" /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc
```

::

---

## Activity 2 — Create a persistent entity CFC

**Activity:** Create `Ticket.cfc` — a persistent entity mapped to the existing `hd_tickets` table:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Ticket.cfc << 'EOF'
component persistent="true" table="hd_tickets" {

  property name="id"          fieldtype="id"  generator="native";
  property name="title"       ormtype="string";
  property name="description" ormtype="string";
  property name="status"      ormtype="string" default="open";
  property name="priority"    ormtype="string" default="medium";
  property name="category"    ormtype="string";

}
EOF
```

Verify the file was created with `persistent="true"`:

```bash
grep "persistent" /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Ticket.cfc
```

::image-box

## Activity 3 — Load entities and run an HQL query

**Activity:** Create `orm_test.cfm` — a page that uses `entityLoad` and `ORMExecuteQuery` to read tickets through Hibernate:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/orm_test.cfm << 'EOF'
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8">

    .result { padding: 1rem; background: #f0f4ff; border-left: 4px solid #3b82d4; margin: 1rem 0; }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>ColdFusion Hibernate ORM — Test</h1>

  <cfscript>
    // entityLoad — load all open tickets via ORM
    openTickets = entityLoad("Ticket", { status: "open" }, "title asc");

    // ORMExecuteQuery — HQL count of high priority tickets
    highCount = ORMExecuteQuery(
      "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Ticket WHERE priority = :p",
      { p: "high" },
      true
    );
  </cfscript>

  <div class="result">
    <strong>entityLoad:</strong> <cfoutput>#arrayLen(openTickets)#</cfoutput> open ticket(s) loaded via ORM<br>
    <strong>HQL COUNT:</strong> <cfoutput>#highCount#</cfoutput> high priority ticket(s)
  </div>

  <h2>Open Tickets (via entityLoad)</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><th>ID</th><th>Title</th><th>Priority</th><th>Category</th></tr>
    <cfoutput>
      <cfloop array="#openTickets#" index="t">
        <tr>
          <td>#t.getId()#</td>
          <td>#encodeForHTML(t.getTitle())#</td>
          <td>#encodeForHTML(t.getPriority())#</td>
          <td>#encodeForHTML(t.getCategory())#</td>
        </tr>
      </cfloop>
    </cfoutput>
  </table>

```

Open `/orm_test.cfm` in the **ColdFusion 2025** browser tab. You should see a count of open tickets loaded by Hibernate and the high priority count from HQL.

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/orm_test.cfm | grep -i "entityload"
