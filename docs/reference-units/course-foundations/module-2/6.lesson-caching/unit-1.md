## Why cache?

ColdFusion applications spend most of their time waiting for database queries and expensive computations. Caching stores a computed result so subsequent requests skip the work entirely — the database is never hit again until the cache expires.

_Cache hit/miss pattern — on a miss the engine queries the DB and warms the cache; on a hit it skips the DB entirely._
::

ColdFusion provides **four caching tiers** you can combine in the same application:

| Tier | API / Tag | Scope | Best for |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Query cache** | `cachedwithin` on `<cfquery>` | Per-query | Repeated identical SQL queries |
| **Application cache** | `cacheGet` / `cachePut` | Application-wide | Any computed value — queries, structs, arrays |
| **Function cache** | `cachedWithin` on `<cffunction>` | Per function call | CFC methods that return the same result for the same inputs |
| **Page cache** | `<cfcache>` | Full page output | Static or near-static pages |

_ColdFusion's four caching tiers — use the highest applicable tier to maximise cache hit rate._
::

---

## 1. Query caching — `cachedwithin`

Add `cachedwithin` to any `<cfquery>` to cache its result for a time span. The second call within the window returns the cached recordset without touching the database:

```cfml
<cfquery name="openTickets" datasource="training_db"
         cachedwithin="#createTimeSpan(0,0,5,0)#">
  SELECT id, title, status, priority
  FROM   hd_tickets
  WHERE  status = 'open'
  ORDER  BY id DESC
</cfquery>
```

`createTimeSpan(days, hours, minutes, seconds)` — `(0,0,5,0)` = 5 minutes.

::hint-box
---
:summary: When does query caching NOT help?
---

Query caching caches the **exact SQL string** as the cache key. If anything in the query changes between calls — a different parameter, a different `WHERE` clause — ColdFusion treats it as a cache miss and re-runs the query. For parameterised queries with changing values, use `cacheGet`/`cachePut` with a computed key instead (e.g. `"tickets_open_dept_" & deptId`).

Also note: `cachedwithin` only works on `<cfquery>` — it does **not** apply to `queryExecute()`. Use `cacheGet`/`cachePut` around `queryExecute()` calls.

::

---

## 2. Application cache — `cacheGet` / `cachePut`

ColdFusion's built-in **ehcache** layer lets you store any value — a query result, a struct, an array — under a string key with a TTL:

::hint-box
---
:summary: What is TTL (Time-To-Live)?
---

**TTL** stands for **Time-To-Live** — it is the maximum age a cached value is allowed to reach before ColdFusion automatically discards it.

You set a TTL using `createTimeSpan(days, hours, minutes, seconds)`:

```cfml
createTimeSpan(0, 0, 5, 0)   // 5 minutes
createTimeSpan(0, 1, 0, 0)   // 1 hour
createTimeSpan(1, 0, 0, 0)   // 1 day
```

Once the TTL expires, the next request finds nothing in the cache (a **cache miss**), re-runs the original work, and stores a fresh value with a new TTL. Until then, every request gets the cached copy without touching the database.

A related concept you will see in the ehcache section is **TTI (Time-To-Idle)** — that clock resets every time the cached value is accessed, so a frequently-read entry can stay in cache indefinitely as long as it keeps getting hit.

::

```cfml
<cfscript>
  data = cacheGet("openTickets");

  if (isNull(data)) {
    // Cache miss — run the query
    data = queryExecute(
      "SELECT id, title, status, priority FROM hd_tickets WHERE status = 'open'",
      {},
      { datasource: "training_db" }
    );
    // Warm the cache for 5 minutes
    cachePut("openTickets", data, createTimeSpan(0,0,5,0));
  }
</cfscript>
```

The pattern is always the same:
1. `cacheGet(key)` — if not null, use it and skip the work
2. On null (cache miss): do the work, then `cachePut(key, value, ttl)`

:summary: ehcache — the engine behind ColdFusion's application cache
---

**ehcache** (now **Terracotta ehcache**) is an open-source, in-process Java caching library originally created by Greg Luck in 2003. ColdFusion has bundled ehcache since ColdFusion 9 as the engine behind `cacheGet`, `cachePut`, and `cachedWithin`.

**What ehcache provides:**
- **In-memory storage** — all cached values live in JVM heap memory (fast, but limited by your server's RAM)
- **TTL (time-to-live)** — entries expire automatically after the duration you pass to `cachePut`
- **TTI (time-to-idle)** — optional: entries expire if not accessed for a set period, regardless of TTL
- **LRU eviction** — when the cache reaches its size limit, the least-recently-used entries are evicted first
- **Named caches** — ColdFusion exposes a default cache region; advanced config in `ehcache.xml` lets you define multiple named regions with different policies

**Useful functions beyond the basics:**

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `cacheGet(key)` | Returns the cached value, or null if not found / expired |
| `cachePut(key, value, ttl)` | Stores a value with a TTL (`createTimeSpan`) |
| `cachePut(key, value, ttl, tti)` | Stores with both TTL and TTI |
| `cacheRemove(key)` | Removes a single key |
| `cacheRemoveAll()` | Clears the entire application cache |
| `cacheGetAllIds()` | Returns an array of all current cache keys |
| `cacheGetMetadata(key)` | Returns hit count, last accessed time, TTL remaining |

**Where the cache lives:**
By default, ehcache is configured in `/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/lib/ehcache.xml`. The default region stores up to 10,000 objects in memory. You can tune this for high-traffic applications, but the defaults work well for learning and moderate production load.

**Important:** the cache is scoped to the **ColdFusion application** (the `this.name` in `Application.cfc`). Two applications on the same CF server have separate cache regions. Restarting ColdFusion clears all cached values.

::

---

## 3. Function-level caching — `cachedWithin` on a CFC method

Add `cachedWithin` to a `<cffunction>` declaration to cache its return value. ColdFusion uses the **function name + argument values** as the cache key — the same call with the same arguments returns the cached result:

```cfml
component {

  public query function getOpenTickets() cachedWithin="#createTimeSpan(0,0,5,0)#" {
    return queryExecute(
      "SELECT id, title, status, priority FROM hd_tickets WHERE status = 'open'",
      {},
      { datasource: "training_db" }
    );
  }

}
```

::hint-box
---
:summary: Function cache vs application cache — which to use?
---

Both `cachedWithin` on a function and `cacheGet`/`cachePut` use the same ehcache layer under the hood. The difference is **where the cache key is managed**:

- **`cachedWithin` on a function** — ColdFusion auto-generates the key from function name + argument signature. Zero boilerplate. Use this when the function is always called with the same arguments, or when each unique argument set should get its own cached result.
- **`cacheGet`/`cachePut`** — you control the key. Use this when you need a shared key across multiple pages/CFCs, when you want to invalidate specific keys on a write (`cacheRemove("openTickets")` after an INSERT), or when caching non-function results like complex structs.

::

---

## 4. Invalidating the cache

Cache invalidation — knowing when to throw away a cached value — is one of the genuinely hard problems in caching. ColdFusion gives you three options:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  // Remove a specific key (e.g. after a write operation)
  cacheRemove("openTickets");

  // Remove multiple keys matching a pattern (CF 2016+)
  cacheRemove("tickets_dept_*", false);

  // Clear everything in the application cache
  cacheRemoveAll();
</cfscript>
```

**The write-through pattern** — always invalidate on writes:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  // INSERT a new ticket
  queryExecute(
    "INSERT INTO hd_tickets (title, status, priority) VALUES (:t, 'open', 'medium')",
    { t: { value: form.title, cfsqltype: "cf_sql_varchar" } },
    { datasource: "training_db" }
  );

  // Immediately invalidate the stale cache key
  cacheRemove("openTickets");
</cfscript>
```

::hint-box
---
:summary: TTL vs explicit invalidation — which strategy?
---

| Strategy | When to use |
|---|---|
| **TTL only** (let it expire) | Data that can tolerate being stale for a few minutes — dashboards, ticket lists, statistics |
| **Explicit invalidation** (`cacheRemove` on write) | Data that must be fresh immediately after a change — user profile, ticket status shown to the owner |
| **Both** | Cache with a safety-net TTL (e.g. 10 min) AND invalidate explicitly on write — belt-and-suspenders for critical data |

For this training environment, TTL-only is fine. In production, always invalidate explicitly after writes to high-visibility data.

## Activity 1 — Query caching with `cachedwithin`

You are going to create a new file called `cache_demo.cfm` in the ColdFusion web root. This file does not exist yet — the command below creates it for you.

**File to create:** `/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/cache_demo.cfm`

In the **Terminal** tab, run the `sudo tee` command below. It writes the full file in one step — no editor needed:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/cache_demo.cfm << 'EOF'

## Activity 2 — Application cache with `cacheGet` / `cachePut`

You are going to **replace** the `cache_demo.cfm` file you created in Activity 1 with an extended version that adds a second section using `cacheGet` / `cachePut`. The `sudo tee` command overwrites the file completely — that is intentional.

**File to overwrite:** `/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/cache_demo.cfm`

In the **Terminal** tab, run:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/cache_demo.cfm << 'EOF'

        {},
        { datasource: "training_db" }

```

Open `/cache_demo.cfm` in the **ColdFusion 2025** browser tab. The first load will show **Cache MISS** (red); refresh and it switches to **Cache HIT** (green).

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/cache_demo.cfm | grep -i "cache"
```

:src: __static__/browser-cache-hit-miss-v1.png

---
_First request shows Cache MISS (red) as data is fetched from the DB and stored; refresh shows Cache HIT (green) — DB skipped._
::

**What you just achieved with `cacheGet` / `cachePut`:**

On the **first load** (Cache MISS), the code called `cacheGet("highPriorityTickets")` and got back `null` — nothing was stored yet. ColdFusion then ran the `queryExecute` against the database, got the results, and immediately called `cachePut("highPriorityTickets", data, createTimeSpan(0,0,5,0))` to store them in ehcache for 5 minutes. The page rendered the data and showed the red MISS indicator.

On the **second load** (Cache HIT), `cacheGet("highPriorityTickets")` returned the stored query object — the `if (isNull(data))` block was skipped entirely. No SQL was sent to the database. The same ticket data was rendered from memory in ehcache and the green HIT indicator confirmed it.

The result: for the next 5 minutes, **every request to this page serves the high-priority ticket list from memory** — the database is not involved at all. After 5 minutes the TTL expires, the next request gets a MISS, re-queries the database, and the cycle starts again. This is the core pattern behind nearly every ColdFusion caching strategy.

::

## Activity 3 — Verify the cache is working on repeated requests

**What this activity proves:**

The first `curl` request is a **cache miss** — ColdFusion has nothing stored yet, so it runs the `cfquery` against the database and calls `cachePut` to store the result. The second `curl` request — sent immediately after — is a **cache hit**: ColdFusion finds the stored value in ehcache and returns it without touching the database at all. Both requests return HTTP 200 and produce identical output, which is exactly how caching should behave. If the cache were broken (wrong key, serialisation error, ORM session conflict), the second request would either throw an exception or return an error page — you would see `error` or `exception` in the output.

In summary: **two clean HTTP 200 responses with identical output and no errors = the cache read/write cycle is working correctly.**

Run the two requests back-to-back in the **Terminal** tab:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8500/cache_demo.cfm
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8500/cache_demo.cfm
```

Then confirm there are no errors in the rendered output:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/cache_demo.cfm | grep -i "error\|exception" || echo "No errors found"
```

Both status lines should read **HTTP 200** and the grep should return **No errors found**. If you open the page in the browser and refresh, you will also see the Section 2 box switch from red **Cache MISS** to green **Cache HIT** — visual confirmation that the second request was served entirely from ehcache.

## Activity 4 — Invalidate the cache with `cacheRemove`

**What this activity proves:**

You have seen that `cachePut` stores a value and `cacheGet` retrieves it. Now you will prove the other side of the cycle: **explicit invalidation**. After calling `cacheRemove`, the next `cacheGet` for that key returns `null` — a forced cache miss — so ColdFusion re-queries the database and stores a fresh value. This is exactly what you would do in production after a write operation (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE) to ensure stale data is never served.

**File to update:** `/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/cache_demo.cfm`

In the **Terminal** tab, overwrite `cache_demo.cfm` with this final version that adds a Section 3 — Cache Invalidation:

Now reload `/cache_demo.cfm` twice in the browser:

1. **First reload** — Section 2 shows **Cache HIT** (green) because the key is still warm from before. Section 3 shows **Before: PRESENT** → **After: GONE**.
2. **Second reload** — Section 2 shows **Cache MISS** (red) again — `cacheRemove` wiped the key so ColdFusion had to re-query the database.

This is the complete invalidation cycle: store → serve from cache → invalidate → forced miss → re-store.

Verify `cacheRemove` is in the file:

grep -i "cacheremove" /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/cache_demo.cfm
