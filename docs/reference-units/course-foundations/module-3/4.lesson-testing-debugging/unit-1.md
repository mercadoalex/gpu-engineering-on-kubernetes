## Debugging and testing — two tools every CF developer needs

Writing code that works once in a happy path is easy. Writing code that keeps working as requirements change, that fails clearly when something is wrong, and that you can fix quickly when it breaks — that requires two disciplines: **debugging** and **testing**.

**Debugging** is how you understand what your code is actually doing right now. ColdFusion gives you `cfdump`, `cflog`, and the CF Admin debugger — tools that let you inspect any variable, trace execution, and read structured log entries without touching production.

**Testing** is how you prove your code does what it should — and keep proving it every time you change something. ColdFusion's testing ecosystem is built around **TestBox**, the de-facto standard BDD/TDD framework for CFML, built by Ortus Solutions and documented at [testbox.ortusbooks.com](https://testbox.ortusbooks.com).

In this lesson you will:
1. Use `cfdump` to inspect live data structures in the browser
2. Write structured log entries with `cflog` and read them from the terminal
3. Install TestBox and write a test spec against the `TicketService` already running in your lab
4. Run the test suite and verify it passes

> **Who does this?** Debugging tools are used by every developer daily. Unit testing is a developer responsibility — not something reserved for QA. In a well-run team, tests live alongside the code and run on every commit.

---

## 1. Debugging with cfdump

`cfdump` renders any ColdFusion variable as a colour-coded HTML table — the fastest way to inspect data during development.

```cfml
<cfset data = {name: "Alex", scores: [95, 87, 72]}>
<cfdump var="#data#" label="Student data">
```

::image-box

:max-width: 640px
---
_`cfdump` renders any CF variable as a colour-coded interactive table — the fastest debugging tool in CFML._
::

Useful `cfdump` attributes:

| Attribute | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `var` | Variable to dump (required) |
| `label` | Heading above the dump |
| `top` | Limit depth of nested structures — prevents huge dumps |
| `expand` | `true` (default) expands nested structures; `false` collapses them |
| `output` | `"browser"` (default) renders HTML; `"console"` writes to the CF console log |
| `format` | `"html"` (default) or `"text"` — use `"text"` for CLI output |

::hint-box
---
:summary: 💡 Never leave cfdump in production code
---
`cfdump` outputs HTML directly into the response. If a `cfdump` call is left in a JSON API endpoint it will corrupt the JSON and break API consumers. Use it only during development, always remove it before committing. A quick check before deploy:

```bash
grep -r "cfdump" /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/
```

If that returns any hits, remove them before shipping.
::

---

## 2. Logging with cflog

`cflog` writes structured entries to a named log file in CF's log directory — visible in the terminal without touching the browser.

```cfml
<cflog file="training" text="Processing ticket #url.id#"    type="information">
<cflog file="training" text="Ticket not found: #url.id#"    type="warning">
<cflog file="training" text="DB error: #cfcatch.message#"   type="error">
<cflog file="training" text="Server shutting down"          type="fatal">
```

**cflog attributes:**

| Attribute | Required | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `file` | Yes | Log filename — CF creates `<name>.log` in the CF logs directory automatically |
| `text` | Yes | Message to write — can include any CFML expressions |
| `type` | No | Severity: `information`, `warning`, `error`, `fatal` — default is `information` |
| `application` | No | `true` adds the application name to the entry; `false` (default) omits it |
| `thread` | No | `true` adds the thread ID — useful for debugging async/scheduled tasks |

The `file` attribute sets the log filename — CF creates the file automatically on the **first write**. It will not exist until at least one `cflog` call has executed. Once it does, you can tail it live:

```bash
tail -f /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/logs/training.log
```

The log format includes a timestamp, thread ID, severity, and your message — structured and grep-friendly.

::hint-box
---
:summary: ⚠️ "No such file or directory" — why tail fails before the first write
---

If you run `tail -f` before any `cflog` call has executed, you will see:

```
tail: cannot open '.../training.log' for reading: No such file or directory
tail: no files remaining
```

This is expected — **ColdFusion does not create the log file until the first entry is written**. The correct sequence is:

**Step 1 — add a cflog call to a page** (skip if you already have one):

```bash
sudo tee -a /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/debug-demo.cfm << 'EOF'
<cflog file="training" text="test entry from debug-demo.cfm" type="information">
EOF
```

**Step 2 — trigger the first write:**

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/debug-demo.cfm > /dev/null
```

**Step 3 — now tail the file:**

```bash
tail -f /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/logs/training.log
```

If you want to open the tail first and wait, use `-F` instead of `-f` — it retries until the file appears:

```bash
tail -F /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/logs/training.log
```

::hint-box

:summary: 💡 cflog vs cfdump — when to use which
---
- **`cfdump`** — use during active development when you want to see a variable's full structure immediately in the browser. Remove before committing.
- **`cflog`** — use for persistent, structured audit trails: recording who did what, catching errors in background tasks, tracing slow queries. Leave it in production code — it writes to a file, not the response.

## 3. TestBox — unit testing for CFML

**TestBox** is the de-facto standard testing framework for CFML, built and maintained by [Ortus Solutions](https://www.ortussolutions.com). It is open source, actively maintained, and the framework you will encounter on almost every serious CFML project.

Full documentation: **[testbox.ortusbooks.com](https://testbox.ortusbooks.com)**

::details-box
---
:summary: What is TestBox — features, versions, and how it fits with ColdFusion
---

TestBox ships with everything a CFML developer needs to write and run tests:

| Feature | What it gives you |
|---|---|
| **BDD syntax** | `describe`, `it`, `expect` blocks that read like plain English specifications |
| **TDD syntax** | Traditional `@Test` annotation style for developers who prefer it |
| **Mocking engine** | `createMock()` and `createStub()` isolate a CFC from its dependencies |
| **Multiple runners** | `StreamingRunner.cfm` (plain text), `HTMLRunner.cfm` (browser), `TextRunner.cfm` (CI-friendly) |
| **Rich reporters** | Text, JSON, TAP, JUnit XML — integrates with GitHub Actions, Jenkins, GitLab CI |
| **beforeEach / afterEach** | Per-test setup and teardown — reset state between each `it()` block |

**How it installs:**
TestBox is a **CommandBox package** — it installs into your project directory alongside your app code, not inside ColdFusion itself. The same test suite runs against Adobe CF, Lucee, or any CFML engine without changes.

**Versions:**
The current stable release is **TestBox 6.x**, which requires CommandBox 6+ and Java 11+. The lab VM ships with both.

**TestBox vs ColdFusion:**
TestBox is not part of Adobe ColdFusion — it is a community package. Adobe CF ships with `MXUnit` (an older built-in test runner), but the CFML community has moved to TestBox as the standard. When you search for CFML testing examples online, TestBox is what you will find.

:summary: 💡 How TestBox fits into this lab — two servers, two roles
---

The lab runs two separate servers. It is important to understand which server does what:

| Server | Port | Runtime | Role |
|---|---|---|---|
| **ColdFusion 2025** | `8500` | Adobe CF | Runs your CF application (`/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/`) |
| **CommandBox / Lucee** | `8888` | Lucee | Runs `~/app/` — including TestBox and the `TicketService` being tested |

TestBox itself **runs on port 8888** (Lucee/CommandBox). Your test specs live in `~/app/tests/` and are served by that Lucee server. The `TicketService.cfc` and `seed-db.cfm` files in `~/app/` are what the specs test — they are **not** the same files in the CF wwwroot.

When you run:
```bash
curl "http://localhost:8888/testbox/system/runners/StreamingRunner.cfm?directory=tests"
```
You are asking the **Lucee server** to execute your specs. Lucee loads your `TicketService.cfc` from `~/app/`, queries the in-memory H2 database declared in `~/app/Application.cfc`, and reports the results.

::

### Install TestBox

TestBox installs into your student app directory via CommandBox:

```bash
cd ~/app
box install testbox
```

This downloads TestBox into `~/app/testbox/` and makes the test runner available at `http://localhost:8888/testbox/`.

::image-box

:max-width: 860px
---
_`box install testbox` pulls TestBox and its dependencies from ForgeBox. The "Initializing libraries" message only appears on the first run — subsequent installs are faster._
::

### What TicketService does

Before writing the spec, understand what you are testing. `TicketService.cfc` in `~/app/` is a service CFC that queries the `hd_tickets` table in the Lucee-side H2 database. It exposes two methods:

| Method | What it returns |
|---|---|
| `getAll()` | An array of ticket structs — every row in `hd_tickets` |
| `getById(id)` | A single ticket struct for the given primary key |

The `beforeAll` block in the test spec calls `seed-db.cfm` via `cfhttp` to populate the in-memory H2 database before any test runs. Without that seed call, `getAll()` returns an empty array and `getById(1)` returns nothing — both tests would fail.

```bash
# Verify TicketService and seed-db.cfm exist in ~/app/
ls ~/app/TicketService.cfc ~/app/seed-db.cfm
```

### Write a test spec

Create the tests directory and spec file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/app/tests
tee ~/app/tests/TicketServiceTest.cfc << 'EOF'
component extends="testbox.system.BaseSpec" {

  function run() {

    describe("TicketService", function() {

      // Seed the database once before the tests are defined.
      // This TestBox version only has beforeEach/afterEach — no beforeAll.
      // Calling cfhttp here runs once when the describe closure is executed.
      cfhttp(url="http://localhost:8888/seed-db.cfm", method="GET");

      var svc = new TicketService();

      it("should return all tickets as an array", function() {
        var result = svc.getAll();
        expect(result).toBeArray();
        expect(arrayLen(result)).toBeGTE(1);
      });

      it("should return a single ticket by id", function() {
        var ticket = svc.getById(1);
        expect(ticket).toBeStruct();
        expect(ticket).toHaveKey("title");
      });

    });

  }
}
EOF
```

_Anatomy of a TestBox spec: each part has a specific role — understand the structure before running the suite._
::

**What each line does:**

| Part | What it does |
|---|---|
| `extends="testbox.system.BaseSpec"` | Required — gives the CFC all TestBox assertion and runner methods |
| `function run()` | TestBox calls this automatically to discover and run all specs |
| `describe("TicketService", ...)` | Groups related tests — the name appears in failure messages |
| `cfhttp(url="...seed-db.cfm")` | Runs once when the `describe` closure executes — seeds the DB before any `it()` |
| `var svc = new TicketService()` | Creates a fresh instance of the service — available to all `it()` blocks below |
| `it("should ...", function() {...})` | One test case — describes one expected behaviour |
| `expect(result).toBeArray()` | Asserts the result is a CF array — throws if it is not |
| `expect(arrayLen(result)).toBeGTE(1)` | Asserts at least one record exists — requires the seed to have run |

::hint-box
---
:summary: 💡 Common TestBox matchers — quick reference
---

| Matcher | What it checks |
|---|---|
| `toBeArray()` | Value is a CF array |
| `toBeStruct()` | Value is a CF struct |
| `toBeTrue()` / `toBeFalse()` | Boolean result |
| `toBe(value)` | Strict equality (`==`) |
| `toBeNull()` | Value is null |
| `toHaveKey("key")` | Struct contains the named key |
| `toBeGTE(n)` | Greater than or equal to n |
| `toBeLTE(n)` | Less than or equal to n |
| `toInclude("text")` | String or array contains value |
| `toBeEmpty()` | Array, struct, or string is empty |
| `toThrow()` | Wrapped function throws an exception |
| `toThrow(type="...")` | Throws a specific exception type |

:summary: 💡 TestBox and every other testing framework — the same pattern
---

TestBox follows the same BDD/TDD patterns used in every major language:

**BDD style** — `describe` / `it` / `expect`

| Framework | Language |
|---|---|
| **TestBox** | CFML |
| **Jest / Vitest / Jasmine** | JavaScript |
| **RSpec** | Ruby |
| **pytest** (with plugins) | Python |

**TDD style** — annotation-based

| Framework | Language |
|---|---|
| **TestBox** `@Test` | CFML |
| **JUnit** `@Test` | Java |
| **NUnit / xUnit** `[Test]` / `[Fact]` | C# |
| **PHPUnit** `@test` | PHP |

The one CFML-specific detail: instead of a CLI command like `jest` or `pytest`, you hit a URL — because the test engine runs inside the application server. Everything else maps directly.
::

### Run the tests

Hit the StreamingRunner with `curl` — plain text output, no interactive CLI, no hanging:

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8888/testbox/system/runners/StreamingRunner.cfm?directory=tests"
```

A passing suite ends with:

```
Tests: 2 Passed: 2 Failed: 0 Errors: 0 Skipped: 0
```

A failing test shows exactly which `it()` block failed and why:

```
[FAIL] TicketService > should return all tickets as an array
  Expected [] to have a length greater than or equal to 1
  >> Did you forget to run seed-db.cfm in beforeAll?
```

::details-box
---
:summary: 📖 TDD, BDD, and SDD — testing approaches compared
---

Three approaches to testing — all valid, each framing the work differently:

**TDD (Test-Driven Development)** — write the test first, watch it fail, then write the code to make it pass. The test drives the implementation — you cannot write code without a failing test to justify it.

**BDD (Behaviour-Driven Development)** — write tests that describe expected *behaviour* in plain language: "it should return all tickets as an array." TestBox's `describe`/`it`/`expect` syntax is BDD. A failing test message tells both developers and product managers exactly what stopped working.

**SDD (Specification-Driven Development)** — the direction the industry is moving toward with AI-assisted development. The specification is the source of truth — both code *and* tests are generated or verified against it.

> SDD is not a replacement for TDD or BDD — it is a layer above them. The generated tests still run as TDD or BDD tests.

> 🎓 AI-assisted development in ColdFusion — generating CFML from specs, building pipelines where a spec drives code generation and test validation — is covered in the **Advanced Course**.

## 4. CF Admin Debugger

For deeper request-level tracing, ColdFusion's built-in debugger appends a full diagnostic panel to every rendered page — showing SQL queries executed, their execution times, template load times, and variable scopes.

Enable it in CF Admin:
1. Open CF Admin → **Debugging & Logging → Debug Output Settings**
2. Check **Enable Request Debugging Output**
3. Add `127.0.0.1` to the IP address restriction list so only your terminal sees the output

Debugging output appears at the bottom of every CF page response. It is automatically hidden from any IP not on the list — safe to leave enabled in the lab, but always disable it before any public deployment.

---

## Activity 1 — Inspect data with cfdump

Create a page that dumps a struct and array so you can see cfdump in action:

```bash
sudo tee /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/debug-demo.cfm << 'EOF'
<cfscript>
  ticket = {
    id:       1,
    title:    "Cannot connect to VPN",
    status:   "open",
    priority: "high",
    tags:     ["network", "remote", "urgent"]
  };
</cfscript>

<cfdump var="#ticket#" label="Sample ticket struct">
EOF
```

Open the **ColdFusion** browser tab and navigate to `/debug-demo.cfm`. You should see the colour-coded dump table with the nested `tags` array expanded inline.

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_cfdump_file
---
#active
Create `debug-demo.cfm` in the CF wwwroot — it must exist and return HTTP 200.

#completed
`debug-demo.cfm` found and accessible. ✓
::

---

## Activity 2 — Write a log entry and read it

Add a `cflog` call to your debug page and tail the log file:

```bash
sudo tee -a /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/debug-demo.cfm << 'EOF'
<cflog file="training" text="debug-demo.cfm loaded by #cgi.REMOTE_ADDR#" type="information">
EOF
```

Now tail the log in a second terminal tab while you refresh the page:

```bash
tail -f /opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/logs/training.log
```

Each page load should add a new timestamped line to the log.

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_cflog_entry
---
#active
A `training.log` file must exist in the CF logs directory.

#completed

::

---

## Activity 3 — Install TestBox and write a test spec

First, verify the files TestBox will test are in place:

```bash
ls ~/app/TicketService.cfc ~/app/seed-db.cfm ~/app/Application.cfc
```

All three must exist. If any are missing, see the hint boxes below before continuing.

Install TestBox into your student app:

```bash
cd ~/app && box install testbox
```

Then create the spec:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/app/tests
tee ~/app/tests/TicketServiceTest.cfc << 'EOF'
component extends="testbox.system.BaseSpec" {

  function run() {

    describe("TicketService", function() {

      // Seed the database once before the tests are defined.
      // This TestBox version only has beforeEach/afterEach — no beforeAll.
      // Calling cfhttp here runs once when the describe closure is executed.
      cfhttp(url="http://localhost:8888/seed-db.cfm", method="GET");

      var svc = new TicketService();

      it("should return all tickets as an array", function() {
        var result = svc.getAll();
        expect(result).toBeArray();
        expect(arrayLen(result)).toBeGTE(1);
      });

      it("should return a single ticket by id", function() {
        var ticket = svc.getById(1);
        expect(ticket).toBeStruct();
        expect(ticket).toHaveKey("title");
      });

    });

  }
}
EOF
```

::simple-task

## Activity 4 — Run the tests

```bash
curl -s "http://localhost:8888/testbox/system/runners/StreamingRunner.cfm?directory=tests"
```

All tests must pass — zero failures, zero errors.

::hint-box
---
:summary: ⚠️ "Page StreamingRunner.cfm not found" — TestBox installed in the wrong directory
---
This error means Lucee cannot find `~/app/testbox/`. Verify:

```bash
ls ~/app/testbox/system/runners/
```

You should see `StreamingRunner.cfm`. If the directory does not exist, re-install from the correct location:

```bash
cd ~/app && box install testbox
```

The `cd ~/app` is required — `box install` places packages relative to the **current working directory**. Installing from `~` or any other path puts `testbox/` somewhere the Lucee server (rooted at `~/app/`) cannot reach.
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: ⚠️ "No matching function [BEFOREALL] found" — beforeAll does not exist in this TestBox version
---
The version of TestBox installed in this lab (`box install testbox` pulls the latest) only exposes **`beforeEach`** and **`afterEach`** as lifecycle hooks inside `describe`. There is no `beforeAll`.

Check what your installed version actually provides:

```bash
grep -n "function before\|function after\|function setUp\|function setup" ~/app/testbox/system/BaseSpec.cfc | head -20
```

**Do not use `beforeAll` — it does not exist.** Instead, place any one-time setup code (like the seed call) directly at the top of the `describe` closure body. It executes once when TestBox processes the suite:

```cfml
describe("TicketService", function() {
  // Runs once when TestBox processes this describe block — no lifecycle hook needed
  cfhttp(url="http://localhost:8888/seed-db.cfm", method="GET");

  it("should ...", function() { ... });
});
```

::

::hint-box
---
:summary: ⚠️ Tests fail with "Expected [] to have length GTE 1" — seed-db.cfm not running
---
This means the `beforeAll` seed call failed silently. The database is empty so `getAll()` returns an empty array. Debug steps:

**Step 1 — test seed-db.cfm directly:**
```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8888/seed-db.cfm
```
You should see output confirming rows were inserted. If you see an error, the seed file has a problem.

**Step 2 — check the Lucee server is running:**
```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:8888/
```
Should return `200`. If not, restart: `cd ~/app && box server restart`

**Step 3 — verify seed-db.cfm exists:**
```bash
ls ~/app/seed-db.cfm
```
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: ⚠️ Why curl and not box testbox run?
---
`box testbox run` starts an interactive CommandBox session that can hang indefinitely in a non-TTY terminal. Hitting the StreamingRunner URL directly with `curl` is equivalent — it calls the same runner, returns the same plain-text output, and never blocks.
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: 💡 TicketService and seed-db.cfm — where they live
---
`TicketService.cfc` and `seed-db.cfm` are in `~/app/` — the Lucee web root. They are **not** the same files as in `/opt/coldfusion2025/cfusion/wwwroot/`. The ones in `~/app/` are what the TestBox runner uses. `seed-db.cfm` is called by the spec's `beforeAll` block via `cfhttp` to populate the Lucee-side in-memory H2 database before the tests run.
::

::hint-box
---
:summary: ⚠️ "Datasource [training_db] doesn't exist" — Application.cfc missing or not loaded
---
`TicketService.cfc` queries a datasource named `training_db` declared in `~/app/Application.cfc`. Verify it exists:

```bash
cat ~/app/Application.cfc
```

It should contain:

```cfml
component {
  this.name = "cfTrainingApp";

  this.datasources["training_db"] = {
    class:            "org.h2.Driver",
    connectionString: "jdbc:h2:mem:training_db;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DATABASE_TO_UPPER=FALSE",
    username:         "sa",
    password:         ""
  };
}
```

If missing, create it and restart:

```bash
tee ~/app/Application.cfc << 'EOF'
component {
  this.name = "cfTrainingApp";

  this.datasources["training_db"] = {
    class:            "org.h2.Driver",
    connectionString: "jdbc:h2:mem:training_db;DB_CLOSE_DELAY=-1;DATABASE_TO_UPPER=FALSE",
    username:         "sa",
    password:         ""
  };
}
EOF
cd ~/app && box server restart
```

`DATABASE_TO_UPPER=FALSE` tells H2 to preserve column-name case exactly as written in SQL.
