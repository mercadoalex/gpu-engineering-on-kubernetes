## What is CommandBox?

CommandBox is the **package manager, CLI, and embedded server** for the CFML ecosystem. Think of it as `npm` + `node` for ColdFusion — one tool that installs ForgeBox packages, manages Lucee/Adobe CF server instances, runs test suites, and provides a CFML REPL, all from the terminal.

_CommandBox is package manager + embedded server + CLI in one tool — the `npm` + `node` of the CFML world._
::

In this lab environment, `box` is already on the PATH and a Lucee 7 server is running on port **8888** via a systemd service. You do not need to install or start anything — CommandBox is ready to use.

---

## The `box` command

Everything in CommandBox goes through the `box` command. You can run single commands inline or drop into the interactive shell:

```bash
# Run a single command inline
box version
box server list

# Drop into the interactive CommandBox shell (exit with 'exit')
box
```

::hint-box
---
:summary: Running box commands — inline vs interactive shell
---

**Inline** (`box <command>`) — runs one command and returns to the system shell. Best for scripting and quick lookups.

**Interactive shell** (`box` with no arguments) — drops you into a persistent CommandBox prompt with tab-completion, command history, and coloured output. Type `exit` or press `Ctrl+D` to leave.

In this lesson all commands are shown in inline form so they work directly in the terminal without entering and exiting the shell.

## Server management

```bash
# Check the status of running servers
box server list

# Start a server (picks up server.json if present)
box server start

# Start with explicit options — engine, port, no browser
box server start cfengine=lucee@7.0.4.34 port=8888 openbrowser=false

# Stop a named server
box server stop name=hungry-minds-training

# Get detailed info about a running server
box server info
```

---

## `server.json` — server configuration file

Persist server settings in a `server.json` file at the project root so any developer starts an identical server with just `box server start`:

```json
{
  "name": "hungry-minds-training",
  "web": {
    "http": { "port": 8888 }
  },
  "app": {
    "cfengine": "lucee@7.0.4.34",
    "webroot": "/home/laborant/app"
  }
}
```

## `box.json` — project package descriptor

`box.json` is CommandBox's equivalent of `package.json` for Node or `composer.json` for PHP. It sits at the **root of your project** and answers three questions:

- **What is this project?** — name, version, author, description
- **What does it depend on?** — ForgeBox packages and their version constraints
- **How is it built/tested?** — custom scripts you can run with `box run-script`

**One `box.json` per project** — you have exactly one at the project root. If you have multiple CFML applications in subdirectories, each gets its own `box.json`.

```json
{
  "name": "helpdesk-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Hungry Minds Training",
  "description": "ColdFusion 2025 Help Desk application",
  "dependencies": {
    "cbvalidation": "^4.0.0",
    "hyper": "^4.0.0"
  },
  "devDependencies": {
    "testbox": "^5.0.0",
    "mockbox": "^3.0.0"
  },
  "scripts": {
    "test": "testbox run"
  }
}
```

**`dependencies` vs `devDependencies`** — just like npm:

| Key | When installed | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `dependencies` | Always — production and development | cbvalidation, Hyper, cbsecurity |
| `devDependencies` | Development only — skipped with `box install --production` | TestBox, MockBox |

**The `box install` workflow:**

```bash
# Install everything in box.json (first checkout or after pulling from git)
box install

# Add a package and save it to box.json dependencies
box install cbvalidation --save

# Add a dev-only package
box install testbox --saveDev

# Install production dependencies only
box install --production
```

All packages land in `{webroot}/modules/` — never commit that folder to git, just like `node_modules`. Add `modules/` to your `.gitignore` and let `box install` recreate it from `box.json`.

**Version constraints follow semantic versioning:**

| Constraint | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `^4.0.0` | Any 4.x.x — minor and patch updates allowed |
| `~4.1.0` | Any 4.1.x — patch updates only |
| `4.0.0` | Exact version only |
| `>=4.0.0` | 4.0.0 or higher |

Run `box install` to install all declared dependencies into `{webroot}/modules/`.

:summary: ForgeBox — the CFML package registry
---

**ForgeBox** ([forgebox.io](https://forgebox.io)) is the public package registry for the CFML ecosystem — the equivalent of npm for JavaScript or Packagist for PHP. CommandBox is the client that installs packages from ForgeBox.

**What lives on ForgeBox:**

| Category | Examples |
|---|---|
| Testing | TestBox, MockBox |
| Validation | cbvalidation |
| MVC frameworks | ColdBox, FW/1 |
| ORM / data | cborm, Quick ORM |
| Security | cbsecurity, BCrypt |
| Utilities | cfcollection, Hyper (HTTP client) |

**Installing packages:**

```bash
# Install latest version
box install testbox

# Install specific version
box install coldbox@6.9.0

# Install and save to box.json dependencies
box install cbvalidation --saveDev

# List installed packages
box list
```

Packages install into `{webroot}/modules/` by default. The `box.json` file tracks what is installed so teammates can run `box install` to reproduce the same environment.

**ForgeBox vs Maven/npm:**
ForgeBox is smaller than npm (thousands of packages vs millions) but covers the CFML ecosystem well. Adobe ColdFusion does not use ForgeBox directly — it is primarily the Lucee/ColdBox community ecosystem. However, CommandBox can also manage Adobe CF server installs using the `adobe` engine identifier (`cfengine=adobe@2025`).

::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Most commonly used ForgeBox packages — what they do
---

| Package | What it does |
|---|---|
| **TestBox** | BDD/TDD testing framework — the standard way to write unit and integration tests in CFML |
| **MockBox** | Mocking library — creates mock objects and stubs for testing |
| **ColdBox** | The most popular MVC framework for ColdFusion/Lucee — routing, interceptors, DI container |
| **cbvalidation** | Validates structs, forms, and model objects with declarative rules |
| **cbsecurity** | Authentication and authorisation framework |
| **cborm** | Enhanced ORM layer on top of ColdFusion's built-in Hibernate ORM |
| **Quick ORM** | ActiveRecord-style ORM — simpler alternative to native CF ORM |
| **Hyper** | HTTP client — makes REST API calls cleanly from CFML |
| **BCrypt** | Password hashing — industry-standard bcrypt implementation for CFML |
| **cfcollection** | Functional collection helpers — `map`, `filter`, `reduce` for queries and arrays |

They install into `{webroot}/modules/` and your app loads them via `Application.cfc` or the ColdBox module system. All are one `box install <name>` away.

## Activity 1 — Verify CommandBox is installed and check the version

**What you are doing:** Confirm `box` is on the PATH and check its version. In the **Terminal** tab, run:

```bash
box version
```

You should see output like `CommandBox CLI v6.x.x` — the exact version installed in this environment.

::hint-box
---
:summary: Getting exec java not found? Run this fix in the Terminal.
---

CommandBox requires Java to run. This playground uses the JRE bundled with ColdFusion 2025, but it may not be on the PATH for your shell session yet. Fix it with one command:

```bash
export JAVA_HOME="/opt/coldfusion2025/jre" && export PATH="$JAVA_HOME/bin:$PATH"
```

Then run `box version` again — it will work. This is a one-time fix for the current session. The next playground rebuild will have Java pre-configured on the PATH permanently.

Run `box version` in the Terminal to confirm CommandBox is installed and on the PATH.

#completed
CommandBox (`box`) is installed. ✓

## Activity 2 — Confirm the Lucee server is running on port 8888

**What you are doing:** The Lucee 7 server is already running on port **8888** via a systemd service — it was started automatically when the playground launched, not by `box server start`. Confirm it is responding correctly with a direct HTTP check.

In the **Terminal** tab, run:

```bash
curl -s -o /dev/null -w "HTTP %{http_code}\n" http://localhost:8888/index.cfm
```

You should see **HTTP 200**. Then open the **Lucee Dev Server** browser tab to see the running application.

Once you can see the Lucee Dev Server page, click the **Lucee Admin Console ↗** button on that page — it opens the Lucee Server Administrator in a new browser tab. The default password is `training`.

You can also navigate directly to:

```
http://localhost:8888/lucee/admin/server.cfm
```

::hint-box
---
:summary: Lucee Dev Server tab shows a blank page or error?
---

The service may still be starting — it can take up to 60 seconds on first boot while it unpacks the engine. Check the current status:

```bash
systemctl status lucee-server.service
```

If the status shows **failed** or **inactive**, check the logs and restart:

```bash
sudo journalctl -u lucee-server.service --no-pager -n 50
sudo systemctl restart lucee-server.service
```

Wait 30–60 seconds, then re-run the `curl` check. Common causes:
- **Java not found** — the JRE at `/opt/coldfusion2025/jre/bin` must be on PATH (the service sets this automatically)
- **Engine download** — if the local engine cache was not pre-baked, CommandBox downloads Lucee on first start (~30 MB, needs internet)
- **Port conflict** — run `ss -tlnp | grep 8888` to confirm nothing else is on port 8888

::

::hint-box
---
:summary: Why does box server list show nothing?
---

`box server list` only shows servers that CommandBox itself started with `box server start`. The Lucee server in this playground is managed by **systemd** (`lucee-server.service`) — it started before you logged in and runs independently of CommandBox's server registry. That is why `box server list` returns empty — the server is running, CommandBox just did not start it.

To check the systemd service status directly:

```bash
systemctl status lucee-server.service
```

## Activity 3 — Initialise the project with `box.json`

**What you are doing:** Create a `box.json` file in the app directory to register it as a CommandBox project. This is the equivalent of `npm init` — it records the project name, version, and any dependencies.

**File to create:** `/home/laborant/app/box.json`

In the **Terminal** tab, run:

```bash
sudo tee /home/laborant/app/box.json << 'EOF'
{
  "name": "helpdesk-app",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "author": "Hungry Minds Training",
  "description": "ColdFusion 2025 Foundations — Help Desk training application",
  "dependencies": {}
}
EOF
```

Verify the file was created:

```bash
cat /home/laborant/app/box.json
```

::image-box
