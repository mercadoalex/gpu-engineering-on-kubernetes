title: Building REST APIs with CFML

name: building-rest-apis-cfml-unit-1

## What is a REST API, and why does it matter?

A **REST API** (Representational State Transfer) is a way for two systems to talk to each other over HTTP. Instead of returning an HTML page, the server returns structured data — almost always JSON — that a client (a browser, a mobile app, another server) can consume programmatically.

Why does this matter for ColdFusion developers?

- Modern frontends (React, Vue, plain JavaScript) don't load full pages — they fetch JSON and update the UI
- Mobile apps need data, not markup
- Microservices and integrations call each other via HTTP APIs
- ColdFusion sits naturally in this model: it already handles HTTP requests, runs queries, and can serialise any struct or array to JSON with a single function call

In this lesson you will work with a fully functional REST API that is **already deployed** in your environment. The goal is to understand how it's built, explore it with `curl`, and internalise the patterns you'll use in your own projects.

### What's already running in your lab

Three files are pre-deployed on the ColdFusion server:

:summary: 📖 HTTP methods — GET, POST, DELETE, PUT, PATCH
---

REST APIs use the HTTP **method** (also called a verb) to express *what* the client wants to do to a resource. You've seen all four in the console — here's what each one means:

| Method | Meaning | Safe? | Idempotent? |
|---|---|---|---|
| `GET` | Read — fetch a resource or a list | ✅ yes | ✅ yes |
| `POST` | Create — submit new data to the server | ❌ no | ❌ no |
| `PUT` | Replace — overwrite an existing resource entirely | ❌ no | ✅ yes |
| `PATCH` | Update — modify part of an existing resource | ❌ no | ✅ yes* |
| `DELETE` | Remove — close or destroy a resource | ❌ no | ✅ yes |

**Safe** means the request does not change server state — you can call it as many times as you like with no side effects. `GET` is safe; `POST` is not (each call creates a new ticket).

**Idempotent** means calling the request twice produces the same result as calling it once. `DELETE` is idempotent — deleting something that is already deleted is still "deleted". `POST` is not — two `POST` calls create two tickets.

In this lesson the API uses three methods:

- **`GET /api/tickets.cfm`** — returns the full list of tickets; no body, no side effects
- **`GET /api/tickets.cfm?id=1`** — returns one ticket by id
- **`POST /api/tickets.cfm`** — creates a new ticket; requires a JSON body
- **`DELETE /api/tickets.cfm?id=1`** — closes ticket #1; no body required

`PUT` and `PATCH` are not implemented here — the ticket model only needs create and close, not partial updates. On a full production API you would add them to support editing ticket fields.

## 1. The simplest JSON endpoint

A ColdFusion REST endpoint is just a `.cfm` file that:
1. Sets the `Content-Type` header to `application/json`
2. Writes serialised data to the response and exits

```cfml
<!--- /api/tickets.cfm (GET — list all tickets) --->
<cfscript>
  cfheader(name="Content-Type", value="application/json");
  cfheader(name="Access-Control-Allow-Origin", value="*");

  q = queryExecute(
    "SELECT t.id, t.title, t.status, t.priority, t.created_at, u.name AS submitter
     FROM   hd_tickets t
     JOIN   hd_users   u ON u.id = t.user_id
     ORDER  BY t.created_at DESC",
    {}, { datasource: "training_db" }
  );

  writeOutput(serializeJSON({ "total": q.recordCount, "tickets": queryToArray(q) }));
</cfscript>
```

No framework, no routing config, no annotations. Just headers, a query, and `serializeJSON`.

---

## 2. Reading URL parameters safely

Always use `val()` or explicit type checks before using URL values in queries.
Never concatenate URL params directly into SQL.

```cfml
<cfscript>
  id = structKeyExists(url, "id") ? val(url.id) : 0;
  if (id LTE 0) {
    cfheader(statuscode="400", statustext="Bad Request");
    writeOutput(serializeJSON({ "error": "id must be a positive integer" }));
    abort;
  }

  q = queryExecute(
    "SELECT id, title, status, priority, description FROM hd_tickets WHERE id = :id",
    { id: { value: id, cfsqltype: "cf_sql_integer" } },
    { datasource: "training_db" }
  );

  if (q.recordCount == 0) {
    cfheader(statuscode="404", statustext="Not Found");
    writeOutput(serializeJSON({ "error": "Ticket not found" }));
    abort;
  }

  writeOutput(serializeJSON(queryToArray(q)[1]));
</cfscript>
```

The `:id` named binding in `queryExecute` is a `cfqueryparam` equivalent — it escapes the value and prevents SQL injection.

---

## 3. Accepting a JSON POST body

POST requests carry their payload in the request body, not the URL. ColdFusion exposes it via `getHttpRequestData().content`:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  rawBody = toString(getHttpRequestData().content);

  if (!isJSON(rawBody)) {
    cfheader(statuscode="400", statustext="Bad Request");
    writeOutput(serializeJSON({ "error": "Request body must be valid JSON" }));
    abort;
  }

  data = deserializeJSON(rawBody);

  if (!structKeyExists(data, "title") || !len(trim(data.title))) {
    cfheader(statuscode="400", statustext="Bad Request");
    writeOutput(serializeJSON({ "error": "title is required" }));
    abort;
  }

  queryExecute(
    "INSERT INTO hd_tickets (title, description, status, priority, user_id, created_at)
     VALUES (:title, :desc, 'open', :priority, :user_id, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP)",
    {
      title:    { value: left(trim(data.title), 255), cfsqltype: "cf_sql_varchar" },
      desc:     { value: data.description ?: "",       cfsqltype: "cf_sql_varchar" },
      priority: { value: data.priority    ?: "medium", cfsqltype: "cf_sql_varchar" },
      user_id:  { value: data.user_id     ?: 1,        cfsqltype: "cf_sql_integer" }
    },
    { datasource: "training_db" }
  );

  cfheader(statuscode="201", statustext="Created");
  writeOutput(serializeJSON({ "created": true }));
</cfscript>
```

---

## 4. Routing on HTTP method

::image-box
---
:src: __static__/cfml-http-method-routing-v1.png
:alt: Decision tree showing cgi.REQUEST_METHOD at the root — three branches lead to GET returning ticket list or single ticket, POST creating a new ticket returning 201 Created, and DELETE closing a ticket returning 200 OK — a fourth branch labelled other leads to a 405 Method Not Allowed response
:max-width: 760px
---
_Route on `cgi.REQUEST_METHOD` to handle GET, POST, and DELETE in a single `.cfm` file._
::

ColdFusion exposes the HTTP verb via `cgi.REQUEST_METHOD`. A single file can handle all methods:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  cfheader(name="Content-Type", value="application/json");
  method = cgi.REQUEST_METHOD;

  if (method == "GET")    { /* list or fetch */ }
  if (method == "POST")   { /* create */        }
  if (method == "DELETE") { /* close ticket */  }

  cfheader(statuscode="405", statustext="Method Not Allowed");
  writeOutput(serializeJSON({ "error": "Method not allowed" }));
  abort;
</cfscript>
```

::hint-box
---
:summary: 💡 Why is it called cgi.REQUEST_METHOD?
---

The `cgi` scope is not a ColdFusion invention — it is the **Common Gateway Interface** (CGI), a standard from 1993 that defined how web servers pass request information to server-side programs. Every web server still populates these variables for every request, and ColdFusion exposes them all in the `cgi` scope.

The most useful ones for API development:

| Variable | Contains |
|---|---|
| `cgi.REQUEST_METHOD` | The HTTP verb — `GET`, `POST`, `DELETE`, etc. |
| `cgi.QUERY_STRING` | Everything after the `?` in the URL |
| `cgi.CONTENT_TYPE` | The `Content-Type` header of the request body |
| `cgi.REMOTE_ADDR` | The client's IP address |
| `cgi.HTTP_HOST` | The `Host` header sent by the client |
| `cgi.SERVER_NAME` | The hostname of the server |

A Perl CGI script from 1995 read the same variable as `$ENV{REQUEST_METHOD}`. The names haven't changed in 30 years because the HTTP spec hasn't changed. When you write `cgi.REQUEST_METHOD` in CFML you are reading the exact same live request metadata — nothing legacy about it.

## 5. CFC Service pattern

Large APIs benefit from separating the HTTP layer (request/response handling) from the data layer (queries and business logic). `TicketService.cfc` is already deployed and provides a clean interface:

```cfml
<cfscript>
  svc     = createObject("component", "TicketService");
  tickets = svc.getAll();           // array of structs
  ticket  = svc.getById(1);         // struct + comments array
  newId   = svc.create("My ticket", "Details here", 1, "high");
  svc.close(newId);
</cfscript>
```

The endpoint file stays thin — it validates input, calls the service, and writes the response. The service holds all the SQL. This separation makes both easier to test and maintain.

::details-box
---
:summary: 📖 What is the Service pattern — and what other patterns exist?
---

### Why a Service CFC?

When your API endpoint does everything — parse the request, validate input, run queries, format output — it becomes hard to read and impossible to test in isolation. The **Service pattern** splits that into two distinct responsibilities:

| Layer | File | Responsibility |
|---|---|---|
| **HTTP layer** | `api/tickets.cfm` | Parse request, validate input, set headers, write response |
| **Data layer** | `TicketService.cfc` | All SQL queries, business rules, data transformation |

The benefit is immediate: you can call `TicketService.getAll()` from a scheduled task, a test script, or a different endpoint without touching any HTTP logic. And you can swap the HTTP layer (say, from `.cfm` to a REST handler) without rewriting any queries.

### Is this a common pattern?

Yes — it is the CFML equivalent of what most frameworks call a **Service Layer** or **Repository pattern**. You will see the same idea in:

- **Java / Spring** — `@Service` classes called by `@RestController`
- **PHP / Laravel** — Service classes called by Controllers
- **Node.js / Express** — service modules called by route handlers
- **.NET** — Service / Repository classes called by API Controllers

The names differ but the principle is identical: keep HTTP concerns out of your data logic.

### Other patterns used in ColdFusion APIs

| Pattern | What it does | When to use |
|---|---|---|
| **Service layer** (this lesson) | CFC holds all queries and business logic | Any API with more than a few endpoints |
| **DAO (Data Access Object)** | CFC per table — only raw CRUD, no business logic | Large apps where business logic is separate from data access |
| **Gateway** | CFC returns sets of data (queries/arrays) for display | Reporting, list pages — read-heavy, no writes |
| **Bean / Transfer Object** | CFC represents a single entity (one ticket) with getters/setters | Strongly-typed data passing between layers |
| **Facade** | Single CFC that wraps multiple services behind one interface | Simplifying a complex subsystem for callers |

In the `TicketService.cfc` here, the lines between Service and DAO are intentionally blurred — it is a pragmatic single-CFC approach suited to a training environment and small-to-medium production apps.

### Is this covered in the Advanced Course?

Yes. The Advanced Course goes into:

- **Full MVC with ColdBox** — Model (Service + DAO), View (templates), Controller (handlers) with dependency injection via WireBox
- **REST handlers** — `coldbox.system.RestHandler` replaces the manual `cgi.REQUEST_METHOD` routing you see here
- **ORM with Hibernate** — `component persistent="true"` maps CFCs directly to database tables, eliminating manual SQL for CRUD operations
- **Unit testing with TestBox** — testing Service CFCs in isolation without an HTTP request

For this lesson, the single-CFC Service pattern is the right level of abstraction — it introduces the concept without the overhead of a full framework.

## Seed the Help Desk database

Before hitting the API, make sure the Help Desk schema is populated. Open the **ColdFusion 2025** browser tab and click the **DB Test** button.

::image-box
---

---
_Click the **DB Test** button to open the seed utility._
::

1. Click **Run Seed Script**

2. A confirmation screen confirms the seed completed successfully

:alt: Confirmation screen after running the seed script showing the schema was created and rows inserted successfully

---
_All four tables created and sample rows inserted — the database is ready._
::

Or seed from the terminal if you prefer:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/seed-db.cfm
```

If the data is already present it skips all inserts and tells you — safe to run multiple times.

---

## Activity 1 — Explore the live API

The endpoint is already running. Use `curl` to inspect it:

```bash
# List all tickets
curl -s http://localhost:8500/api/tickets.cfm | python3 -m json.tool

# Confirm Content-Type header
curl -s -I http://localhost:8500/api/tickets.cfm | grep -i content-type
```

You should see a JSON response with a `total` count and a `tickets` array. The `Content-Type` header must be `application/json`.

::hint-box
---
:summary: 💡 What does python3 -m json.tool do?
---
It pretty-prints raw JSON with indentation. Without it, `curl` returns the JSON as a single compact line. Use it any time you want to read the response clearly in the terminal.
::

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_api_list
---

::

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks

---
#active
The JSON response must contain at least 1 ticket (`total` > 0).

#completed

## Activity 2 — Fetch a single ticket

Add the `?id=` parameter to fetch one specific ticket:

```bash
# Fetch ticket #1
curl -s "http://localhost:8500/api/tickets.cfm?id=1" | python3 -m json.tool

# Test a 404 — ticket 999 does not exist
curl -s -w "\nHTTP %{http_code}\n" "http://localhost:8500/api/tickets.cfm?id=999"
```

The first command should return a single ticket object with a `title` field. The second should return HTTP 404 and `{"error":"Ticket not found"}`.

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_single_ticket
---
#active
`GET /api/tickets.cfm?id=1` must return a ticket object with a `title` field.

#completed
Single ticket fetch works. ✓
::

---

## Activity 3 — Create a ticket via POST

Send a JSON body to create a new ticket:

```bash
curl -s -X POST http://localhost:8500/api/tickets.cfm \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"title":"Monitor flickering","description":"Display flickers on login","priority":"high","user_id":3}' \
  | python3 -m json.tool
```

A successful response returns HTTP 201 and `{"created": true}`. Verify the ticket was actually saved by listing again:

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:8500/api/tickets.cfm | python3 -m json.tool | grep -A3 "Monitor flickering"
```

::hint-box
---
:summary: 💡 Why 201 and not 200?
---
HTTP **201 Created** is the correct status code when a new resource has been successfully created. Using `200 OK` for a POST that creates data is technically incorrect — it makes it harder for clients to distinguish between "I retrieved data" and "I created something new".
::

::simple-task
---
:tasks: tasks
:name: verify_post_ticket
---
#active
`POST /api/tickets.cfm` with a JSON body must return `{"created": true}`.

#completed
POST creates a new ticket. ✓
::
